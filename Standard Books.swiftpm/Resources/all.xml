		<summary type="text">Smoky, a gray-colored horse, grows into adulthood on the ranges of the American West.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>On an isolated range in the American West, a young horse named Smoky is born and raised. Allowed to run free for the first few years of his life, he’s later captured and tamed by a cowboy named Clint. Clint sees something special in Smoky, and quickly falls in love with the intelligent, wild young horse. As the years pass, Smoky must overcome many challenges ranging from mountain lions and winter storms to horse thieves and the greatest challenge the wilderness faces: modern society.</p>
			<p>Winner of the 1927 Newbery Medal, <i>Smoky the Cowhorse</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/will-james">Will James’s</a> most famous book. Upon winning the award, James expressed surprise, because he had intended the book for adults.</p>

		<summary type="text">A compilation of four distinct but entwined animal tales featuring the denizens of the Green Meadows.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thornton-w-burgess">Thornton W. Burgess</a> was an American naturalist and the author of dozens of books for children, the most enduring of which are <i>Old Mother West Wind</i> and <i>The Burgess Bird Book for Children</i>. Burgess was a passionate twentieth-century conservationist who dedicated his life to teaching children and their families about the importance of the natural life of the northern North American forest.</p>
			<p>The <i>Green Meadow Stories</i> compilation is made up of four distinct but entwined tales: those of Happy Jack Squirrel, Mrs. Peter Rabbit, Bowser the Hound, and Old Granny Fox. Through the adventures of these focal characters readers are introduced to the wider territory of the Green Meadows, the Green Forest, and the Smiling Pond as well as to the animals’ Great World.</p>
			<p>The animals of Burgess’s stories are anthropomorphized, undoubtedly, but not caricatured: these are not the twee creatures of Disney cartoons. Their behaviour is explained in ways that would be understandable to a human child—this is fiction, after all—but Burgess’s “little people of the forest” are not simply humans dressed in fur and feathers. The original illustrations in Burgess’s books (by Harrison Cady, not reproduced in this edition) show the animals wearing clothes, but Burgess’s own descriptions of animals are more natural and metaphorical, and less fantastic. For example, he describes Chatterer the Red Squirrel, “who always wears a red coat with vest of white,” a compact way of communicating the look of a squirrel that many of today’s children will never have seen with their own eyes. Less pleasantly, it is Peter Rabbit’s fur and flesh that is rent when Hooty the Owl tears Peter’s “coat” one night on the Old Pasture.</p>
			<p>Burgess has tremendous respect for the creatures he depicts, as well as for their natural home. While the presentation of the Green Meadow is hardly “Nature, red in tooth and claw,” it is surprisingly unsentimental. Peter Rabbit, for example, lives a highly anxious life under threat from the many predators who would enjoy having him for dinner; similarly, Happy Jack Squirrel experiences days and nights of terror when Shadow the Weasel discovers Happy Jack’s home and hunts him relentlessly. During a long, hard winter, Granny Fox and Reddy Fox come close to starving, and Old Man Coyote leads Bowser the Hound on a dangerous chase that may result in one or the other dying. Despite other fanciful, sentimental elements of storytelling, Burgess does not sugarcoat prey/predator relationships or the precarity of wild animals’ lives.</p>
			<p>Burgess is a clear conservationist in his representations of hunting. The animals are highly aware of hunters and their “dreadful guns.” It is a notable moment in this collection when Farmer Brown’s Boy decides he will no longer use his gun to harm the little people of the Green Meadow and the Green Forest. The stories are also notable in their detailed representation of a largely intact forest, something few children in the twenty-first century will experience.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, these are books for children, and they contain plenty of sweetness and light. Animal pairings—such as when Peter Rabbit meets the dainty Little Miss Fuzzytail, the future Mrs. Rabbit—are vague but sentimental and soon lead to proud new families of Rabbits, Ducks, Deer, and Owls. The “little people” celebrate the arrival of each spring’s babies, mark each other’s new relationships and homes, play together, and even help each other survive. They laugh, tease, and trick each other—a fanciful interpretation of animal behaviour that could lead to a reader’s life-long fascination with, and respect for, forest creatures—and for generations of readers, they did just that.</p>
			<p>The stories are also more didactic than most twenty-first-century authors would dare to be. There are morals associated with most stories, often attributed to the animal about whom the story is being told. Through this practical teaching, Burgess suggests a correspondence between how animals and humans live; but he consistently clarifies that animal intelligence is different from, but certainly no less than, human intelligence.</p>
			<p>Unlike the bouncy rhyming verses of many of today’s children’s books, Burgess’s sentences have a somewhat old-fashioned cadence, creating the distinct and appealing music of traditional storytelling. Burgess’s episodic chapters are eminently readable and particularly come to life when they are voiced by animated reading-aloud. For older readers looking for something different to share with children, or for new readers beginning to tackle “chapter books,” the tales of the <i>Green Meadow Stories</i> collection are a delightful place to discover Burgess and his animal friends.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of four animal tales featuring the denizens of the Green Forest.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>American naturalist and conservationist <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thornton-w-burgess">Thornton W. Burgess</a> was the author of more than one hundred books for children; the best-remembered of these is <i>Old Mother West Wind</i>, which was originally written for his young son. Burgess also wrote dozens of books about the creatures of the northern North American forest, four of which are collected here as the <i>Green Forest Stories</i>.</p>
			<p>This <i>Green Forest Stories</i> compilation focuses on Lightfoot the Deer, Blacky the Crow, Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, and twin bear cubs Woof-Woof and Boxer. Readers may have encountered these characters in other of Burgess’s stories about the “little people” of the Massachusetts forest. Burgess’s earliest ventures into animal fantasy are roughly contemporary with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling">Rudyard Kipling’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling/just-so-stories">Just So Stories</a></i> and Beatrix Potter’s tales of various animals, and represent the most lasting American entry into this genre.</p>
			<p>Animal fantasy is a sub-genre of children’s literature in which animals are anthropomorphized into human-like characters and use language like humans. It is often criticized by those who want readers to experience more realistic representations of animals and the natural world, but animal fantasies engage a millennia-old tradition, in the Western canon reaching back at least as far as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aesop">Aesop’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aesop/fables/v-s-vernon-jones">Fables</a></i>; animal characters feature in teaching stories for children (and adults) in cultures around the world. Burgess’s stories are intended for children in the early elementary grades. The challenges and triumphs of the “little people” in his stories will feel identifiable to many young readers, and the snippets of moralizing and authorial commentary interleaved with the actions of the plot reflect a teaching device with a long history.</p>
			<p>In the late twentieth century, Burgess fell out of favour with teachers and librarians. This shift occurred in part due to changing tastes in literary style and in part due to a changing society. Burgess is entirely a writer of his time. Most of the animals he depicts are male, and many of the female animals who wander into the stories are more passive and more stereotyped than the kinds of representation preferred for girls today. (Such is not the case, however, of Old Granny Fox, who may be the smartest of the little people Burgess represents and certainly does not lack agency or self-determination.)</p>
			<p>The style of Burgess’s storytelling is undeniably old-fashioned but still deserves consideration. Although the writing is often simple and plain, there are rhetorical flourishes that reveal the author’s attention to craft. In particular, Burgess’s use of formulaic expressions such as “jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun” and “the Merry Little Breezes” links these tales to an orality that stretches back to at least <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-iliad/william-cullen-bryant">The Iliad</a></i> and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey/william-cullen-bryant">The Odyssey</a></i> of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer">Homer</a> (think of phrases such as “the wine-dark sea,” “rosy-fingered Dawn,” and “bright-eyed Athena”). Through his broader use of repetition and through onomatopoeia, Burgess underscores characteristics of his characters’ real-life forest counterparts—the way a chickadee calls, a squirrel scolds, or a rabbit lopes, for example.</p>
			<p>In these stories, as in the <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thornton-w-burgess/green-meadow-stories">Green Meadow Stories</a></i> collection, we observe features that signal Burgess’s experience as a writer for periodicals and as an early radio broadcaster. Each chapter begins with reminders about the previous chapter, and chapters end with either a strong, propulsive conclusion or a traditional cliff-hanger. The chapters are generally quite short—a comfortable size to read as a bedtime story, and just long enough to hold a new reader’s attention without demanding too much of that reader’s energy. The strong narrative voice sounds distinctly like oral storytelling. One can almost imagine a small group of young people seated in a circle at the storyteller’s feet.</p>
			<p>That image captures the essence of these animal tales. They are light, bright peeks into a complex and beautiful world, a world any girl or boy may want to pursue through study or personal explorations. As humanity faces the daily loss of animal species, stories that delight readers and listeners, that encourage them to learn about and respect the creatures of the non-human world, deserve our renewed attention and respect.</p>

		<summary type="text">Nils Holgersson, transformed to an elf, learns the meaning of kindness during his adventures with a flock of wild geese.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>The Wonderful Adventures of Nils</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/selma-lagerlof">Selma Lagerlöf</a> tells the story of Nils Holgersson, a young boy who is transformed into an elf after a set of misdeeds. Escaping with his family’s farm goose he joins up with a flock of wild geese and travels with them across Sweden as they return to their annual nesting grounds in Lapland.</p>
			<p>The story was originally written as a commission for the Swedish National Teachers’ Association to write a geography book for children and has become a firm favourite in the country. It’s been adapted for screen many times, translated into over 30 languages and, until recently, was the artwork on the 20 krona banknote.</p>
			<p>Although originally published in English in two volumes—the second starting at “The Story of Karr and Grayskin”—here they are presented as a single combined story.</p>

			<p>In <i>Hindu Tales from the Sanskrit</i> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/s-m-mitra"><abbr>S. M.</abbr> Mitra</a> has collected and transcribed in English various fables and short stories from across the Sanskrit tradition. The stories’ characters range from kings to mice and they find themselves in all manner of situations, from the mundane to the magical. Regardless of the setting, there is a common thread of moral choices, whether personal or for family and friends, that runs through the collection.</p>
			<p>Siddha Mohana Mitra was an Indian author and political commentator, who was most famous at the time for his numerous books and articles for the British market on the colonial rule of India. This collection, edited by the author and translator Nancy Bell, was published in 1919, and was designed to be both appealing as a set of fairy tales and useful as a teaching tool for children’s moral perception of the world.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short humorous fables for children, most purporting to tell the origin of animal characteristics such as the camel’s hump.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Just So Stories</i> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, first published in 1902, is now considered to be a classic of children’s literature. The twelve tales included are all humorous “origin” stories purporting to tell how certain animals gained their distinctive features. For example, “The Elephant’s Child” tells how the elephant gained its long trunk because of a baby elephant having its nose pulled and stretched by a crocodile.</p>
			<p>The stories originated as bedtime tales Kipling invented for his daughter and told to her each night. The stories had to be told in exactly the same words each night—“just so”—or his daughter would complain.</p>
			<p>Early editions of <i>Just So Stories</i> were illustrated in black and white by Kipling himself, which lends the collection a certain charm. We have reproduced these illustrations in the Standard Ebooks edition of the book.</p>

		<summary type="text">After his parents die, a young Scottish man travels to see his only remaining relative, expecting to be welcomed, but instead finds his life and liberty in grave danger.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written in 1886, <i>Kidnapped</i> is an adventure novel set in Scotland in the mid-1700s, not long after the Jacobite rebellion in the Highlands which had attempted to set Bonnie Prince Charlie on the throne. This rebellion was put down brutally and afterwards the Government imposed strict controls on Highlanders, outlawing many clan leaders.</p>
			<p>The protagonist of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson">Stevenson’s</a> novel is young David Balfour, who is in his late teens. David sets off from his hometown after the death of both of his parents to seek out his sole remaining relative, his uncle Ebenezer. Expecting to be welcomed, he is shocked by the hostile reception he is given by the old man, who is a hermit much despised by his neighbours. Ebenezer tricks young David and arranges for him to be kidnapped and taken to be sold into slavery. A series of unexpected events occur, however, and David finds himself at large in the Highlands, seeking the help of the outlaw Alan Breck Stewart, who entangles him in further complications.</p>
			<p><i>Kidnapped</i> is one of Stevenson’s most popular novels for young people, and has been adapted several times for movies and television.</p>

		<summary type="text">After coming into his fortune and evading his uncle’s schemes, young gentleman David Balfour continues his adventures in 18th century Scotland, helping a politically unwelcome friend escape into France, avoiding the hangman himself, finding his place as a gentleman in Edinburgh society, and falling in love with the daughter of a notorious Macgregor clansman.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson">Robert Lewis Stevenson</a> continues the story of David Balfour, starting directly where <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson/kidnapped">Kidnapped</a></i> left off. Compared to <i>Kidnapped</i>, <i>Catriona</i> is much more of a comedy of manners, politics, and romance than a simple action-adventure story, but it still has several of Stevenson’s trademark escapades, imprisonments, and daring escapes.</p>
			<p>The title character David Balfour attempts to navigate, to his own peril, his apparent role in the Appin murder, the subsequent trial of James of the Glens, life among high society, and the machinations of James Macgregor Drummond, the father of David’s great love, Catriona.</p>

		<summary type="text">An eleven-year old English boy gets involved in a continuous series of amusing adventures to the exasperation of his long-suffering family.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Just William</i>, published in 1922, was the first of a long series of well-loved books about William Brown, an eleven-year old English schoolboy, written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/richmal-crompton">Richmal Crompton</a>. William is continually scruffy and disreputable, and has a talent for getting into trouble and becoming involved in various inventive plots and scrapes, to the exasperation of his long-suffering parents and older siblings.</p>
			<p>Crompton continued to write stories about the amusing adventures and mishaps of William Brown right up until her death in 1969. Some 39 book collections of stories about William were eventually published, entertaining several generations of children. Despite this, Crompton felt her real work was in writing novels for adults, of which she wrote some 41—most now forgotten and out of print.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Oscar Wilde’s children’s stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Early in his literary career <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> published two collections of children’s stories and fairy tales. This edition contains the stories from both <i>The Happy Prince and Other Tales</i>, published in 1888, and <i>A House of Pomegranates</i>, published in 1891. The two books present two slightly different sensibilities, and though stories like “The Happy Prince” and “The Selfish Giant” have grown into timeless children’s classics, the darker tales told in <i>A House of Pomegranates</i> remain less well known and were, as Wilde said, “intended neither for the British child nor the British public.”</p>
			<p>While Wilde is best known as a playwright and celebrated for his wit and aphorisms, his early writings contain the seeds of his biting criticism of late Victorian society. And this was true no more so than in these fairy stories which explore the ideals of friendship, love, kindness and charity; the stories both celebrate these attributes and show how they are too often twisted or ignored by the very societies that espouse them.</p>

		<summary type="text">The Prince of England and a pauper find their identities switched.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> remains one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Twain’s</a> more popular novels, having been adapted many times for the stage, screen, and elsewhere. When Tom Canty, a young pauper in London, meets Prince Edward, the two switch clothes and assume the other’s identity. Tom then learns the life of royalty, while the true prince discovers the troubles of commoners.</p>
			<p>As usual, Twain delivers both humor and social commentary in abundance. Although aimed at children, <i>Pauper</i> provides moral and social criticism of topics like the justice system and inequality, and deals with themes which appeal to readers of all ages.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of a young boy and his friend, an escaped slave, on the Mississippi river in the Antebellum South.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>One of the great American novels, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> tells the story of Huck Finn and his travels with Jim, an escaped slave. Roundly criticised by contemporary reviewers for its colorful and literal language and even banned by several libraries, it sealed its historical importance in part by being one of the first novels to be written entirely in American vernacular.</p>
			<p>While <i>Huck Finn</i> is, on its face, an adventure tale for younger readers, it’s also a cutting satire and a nuanced examination of racism and morality. Hemingway called it “the best book we’ve had.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl follows a white rabbit into a strange land of poetry, humor, and whimsy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Everyone’s familiar with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll">Lewis Carroll’s</a> famous children’s classic and the huge influence it’s had on modern culture. The Mad Hatter, the Duchess, the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar—all of these strange and familiar creatures appear in <i>Alice</i>, and the nonsensical style, memorable poems, and colorful set pieces are just as influential.</p>
			<p>The book was originally written as gift to Alice Liddel, the daughter of one of Carroll’s friends. Carroll had told the story to Alice during a rainy-day boat trip up a river. It stuck in his mind, and a few years later the completed manuscript was published in 1865. More than 150 years later, it’s just as popular as it ever was.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of fairy tales that exhibits India’s rich folk tale tradition.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Although many readers might associate the term “fairy tales” with the Germanic or Celtic folk tale tradition—like in the stories collected by the Brothers Grimm—countries like India have their own rich history of fairy tales. Many of these tales, infused with a local flavor, bear a striking structural and thematic similarity to those with which Western readers are accustomed: moral allegories, talking animals, gambling incidents, and the like. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-jacobs">Joseph Jacobs</a> has carefully selected 29 fairy tales from the Jatakas, the <i>Fables of Bidpai</i>, the <i>Tales of the Sun</i>, the <i>Baluchi Folktales</i>, the <i>Folktales of Kashmir</i>, and other Sanskrit sources. These stories are a humorous and imaginative showcase of India’s rich fairy tale tradition.</p>
			<p>Joseph Jacobs was an Australian folklorist who devoted most of his career to collecting fairy tales from around the world. His collections on English fairy tales have immortalized stories such as “Jack and the Beanstalk,” “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” “The Three Little Pigs,” “Jack the Giant Killer” and “The History of Tom Thumb.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Germanic fairy tales containing the classic stories of Cinderella, Snow-White, Rapunzel, and other well known characters.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When it was first published in 1812 as <i>Children’s and Household Tales</i>, this collection of Germanic fairy tales contained eighty-six stories and was criticized because, despite the name, it wasn’t particularly well-suited to children. Over the next forty-five years, stories were added, removed, and modified until the final seventh edition was published in 1857, containing 210 fairy tales. Today, the book is commonly referred to as <i>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</i>.</p>
			<p>These fairy tales include well-known characters such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Rapunzel, as well as many more that never became quite as popular. Over the years, these stories have been translated, retold, and adapted to many different media.</p>
			<p>This is a collection of Margaret Hunt’s 1884 English translation, originally published in two volumes.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mischievous and cocky young boy, Peter Pan, takes Wendy and her brothers on adventures on a fantasy island consisting of mermaids, pirates, Native Americans, and fairies.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Peter Pan, a young boy who refuses to grow up, takes Wendy to the lost boys on the fantasy island of the Neverland to be their mother. Wendy’s two brothers, John and Michael, accompany them on their many adventures, including skirmishes with the Native Americans who reside there, and battles with pirates, led by Pan’s nemesis Captain Hook, who is said to be feared even by Captain Flint and Long John Silver.</p>
			<p><i>Peter and Wendy</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-m-barrie"><abbr>J. M.</abbr> Barrie’s</a> most famous work, was influenced by Barrie’s relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family and the death of his older brother, who, by dying in his youth, would remain a young boy forever. It began as a play first performed in 1904, and then was later published as a novel in 1911. A large number of adaptations including plays, television, and films have since been produced.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Tipperary man Darby O’Gill is imprisoned by the fairies of Sleive-na-mon in their home under the hollow mountain, he starts a lasting friendship with their King Brian Connors. Using the voice of a local story-teller, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herminie-templeton-kavanagh">Herminie Templeton Kavanagh</a> shares this series of tales of Darby and King Brian’s adventures. We follow Brian as his fairies are banished from Heaven for not taking sides as angels wage war against each other, and we follow Darby to face the Banshee in Croaghmah, the realm of ghosts and the final destination of the spectral death coach driven by its headless horseman. We join Darby as he matches wits with the crafty Leprechaun, and join King Brian as he debates philosophy with parish priest Father Cassidy. Pious Christianity, superstition, and pagan folklore are each real and important elements of Darby’s life and world. Reconciling them is a persistent theme in Kavanaugh’s stories, one that was largely absent from the classic children’s film that it inspired.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl is moved to the English countryside where she starts restoring a neglected garden, and uncovers secrets in the process.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Mary’s parents fall ill and die, forcing her to be transplanted from India to the English countryside. She arrives at a strange and foreign country manor, where she discovers a long-neglected garden and hears strange sobbing noises at night.</p>
			<p>Thus begins <i>The Secret Garden</i>, a children’s book with an unusually dense collection of themes, symbols, and motifs. Mary’s personal development mirrors her unraveling the secret of the hidden garden, and a subtle backdrop of magical realism adds a mysterious air to the proceedings.</p>
			<p>Contemporary reception left <i>The Secret Garden</i> largely unnoticed, eclipsed by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/frances-hodgson-burnett">Hodgson’s</a> other work, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/frances-hodgson-burnett/little-lord-fauntleroy"><i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i></a>. Since then, however, the book’s reputation has steadily grown, with modern critics considering it one of the finest children’s books of the 20th century.</p>

		<summary type="text">Pollyanna recovers from an automobile accident with the help of a nearby dowager, before leaving the country to later return to rural Vermont.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>Pollyanna Grows Up</i> we follow the titular character as she “grows up” through a story told in two connected parts. The first part takes place in Boston when she is age 13, having just been rehabilitated from severe injuries sustained in an automobile accident. As she leaves the hospital, she is sent to stay with a nearby dowager, who has long withdrawn into grief, pining for her lost nephew. Pollyanna is to be her “cure.” After leaving Boston, Pollyanna leaves the country with her Aunt Polly and doesn’t return to Vermont until she is 20 years old.</p>
			<p>While in Boston, Pollyanna observes her host’s isolation and depression, which sits in stark contrast with the opulence of her home and her material wealth. Meanwhile, naive, relentlessly positive, literal-minded Pollyanna, often oblivious to the structure of society around her, slowly comes to understand the dire, grinding poverty, isolation, and alienation that turn-of-the-century Boston was also home to. Human connection is a central theme of the book and Pollyanna begins to engage with broader cultural and moral questions of her society before departing the country.</p>
			<p>In the second half of the book, Pollyanna acts as host to the friends she made in Boston. As such, she reconnects with them and puts them in touch with her friends and family in Vermont. As a part of growing up, Pollyanna must now address questions of how these relationships might change as her age and social status change. She must reconcile the sense of obligation she feels with her desires, and with the wants and needs of those around her. Old relationships are expanded, and new relationships are formed (or revealed) with each, in the end, more connected to all.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphan’s unrelenting optimism sees her through adversity and lifts up her new community.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Eleven year-old Pollyanna, having recently been orphaned by her widower father, is sent back East to be cared for by her dutiful and stoic Vermont aunt. Naive and ever-literal, this very positive young girl brings with her an infectious habit of instinctive gratitude that was taught to her as “the game” by her late father. This game serves her well, while also uplifting the turn of the century New England community which becomes her home.</p>
			<p><i>Pollyanna</i> inspired the production of five feature length films and fifteen subsequent novels, including books written by six other authors. Pollyanna was a best-selling children’s book when first published, and the eponyms “Pollyanna” and “Pollyanna Principle” have taken a lasting place in our culture.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of children visiting the seaside free a captive mermaid and visit her domain.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Wet Magic</i> was the last novel for children published by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">E. Nesbit</a>. It was originally serialized in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> in 1912, with a book version published in 1913.</p>
			<p>In the book, four brothers and sisters are on their way to a holiday at the beach. While traveling on a train, they’re excited to read about the purported sighting of a mermaid near the coastal town where they’ll be staying, and agree among themselves to join the hunt for this mythical creature. But when they arrive, they discover that the mermaid has been captured and put on show at a circus at the local fairground. After the older children encounter another mermaid in the sea, who implores them to help, they agree they must do what they can to free the captured one. This leads them on to strange adventures.</p>
			<p>While <i>Wet Magic</i> has much of Nesbit’s characteristic charm and humor, it doesn’t appear to have been received as well as her other books, nor has it been as frequently reprinted.</p>

		<summary type="text">Four children are reunited with an ancient, magical creature and go on adventures through time with a magic amulet.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this conclusion to the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/psammead-trilogy">Psammead Trilogy</a>, Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane are reunited with the cantankerous Sand-fairy. While the old creature can’t grant them wishes anymore, it points them towards an old Egyptian amulet that can grant their hearts’ desire—in this case the return of their parents and baby brother. While their amulet is only half of a whole, it still acts as a time portal which they use to visit locales like Ancient Egypt, Babylon, Atlantis, and even a utopian future in search of the missing other half.</p>
			<p>Perhaps one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">E. Nesbit’s</a> most personal works, <i>The Story of the Amulet</i> benefited from her interest in the ancient world, particularly Egypt. With the help of A. E. Wallis Budge, to whom the book is dedicated—then Head of the Assyrian Departments of the British Museum and translator of the Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i>—she conducted extensive research on the topic and is thus able to bring an exquisite attention to detail. For example, the titular amulet is shaped after the <i>tyet</i>, an Egyptian symbol also known as the “knot of Isis.” Likewise, the inscription at the back of the amulet is written in authentic Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>
			<p>A staunch supporter of democratic socialism and a founding member of the Fabian Society, E. Nesbit cultivated friendships with other like-minded writers, such as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-bernard-shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells">H. G. Wells</a>, whose influence on this book is easy to notice. She practiced what she preached, so much so that despite her literary successes, her acts of charity brought her close to bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>These political beliefs are prominently displayed in the book. The children encounter memorable characters during their adventures, chief among them the Queen of Babylon, who causes quite a stir when she later pays them a call in their contemporary London. When the visiting Queen witnesses the squalid living conditions of the London working class, she’s amazed at how poorly they’re treated compared to the slaves of her own Babylon. Likewise, the utopian future—which features a wink to her friend H. G. Wells, the “great reformer”—is a striking contrast in terms of the happiness, care, and education of the general populace.</p>
			<p>The book’s legacy can be found in the works of other writers. Most notably, C. S. Lewis incorporated several elements in his <i>Chronicles of Narnia</i>: the Calormene civilization of <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> draws heavily from <i>The Amulet</i>’s Babylon, and the episode in <i>The Magician’s Nephew</i> where Jadis, the White Witch, causes chaos during her short stay in London is also a direct homage to the aforementioned visit from the Queen. The format of these stories, where a group of people take their audience on adventures through time and space to learn about distant cultures, is an uncanny precursor to the popular British TV series <i>Doctor Who</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">After their father is forced to leave them, three children and their mother must live in near-poverty in the country, where their lives are enlivened by the nearby presence of a railway line.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Railway Children</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">Edith Nesbit’s</a> most well-known and well-loved book for young readers. Since its first book publication in 1906, it has been made into movies, radio plays and television series several times, dramatised in the theatre, performed in actual railway stations, and even turned into a musical.</p>
			<p>It tells the story of three children: Roberta, Peter and Phyllis, who with their mother are forced to leave their comfortable suburban home and go to live in a small cottage in the country, after their father is taken away from them for what at first seem inexplicable reasons. They live there very quietly, not going to school, whilst their mother writes stories and poems to earn a small income. The children’s lives, however, are greatly enlivened by their proximity to a nearby railway line and station, in which they take great interest. They befriend the railway staff and have several adventures in which they demonstrate considerable initiative and courage.</p>
			<p>One unusual topic touched on by the book is the then-current Russia-Japan war, which divided opinion in England. Nesbit was clearly opposed to the actions of the Tsarist government of Russia, and she introduces into the story a <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>-like Russian writer who has escaped from a prison camp in Siberia, to which he was condemned for publishing a book espousing his liberal views.</p>

		<summary type="text">Five children once again encounter an ancient, magical creature and go on adventures around the world with its magic carpet.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Like other <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">E. Nesbit</a> stories, <i>The Phoenix and the Carpet</i> was initially published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>. While <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit/the-railway-children">The Railway Children</a></i> or <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit/five-children-and-it">Five Children and It</a></i> proved more popular, <i>Phoenix</i> has still been adapted into three BBC TV series and a film.</p>
			<p>The story picks up some time after the events of <i>Five Children and It</i>. The children are back in London and encounter another ancient, magical creature: this time a noble, beautiful, arrogant, and vain Phoenix. He comes with a magic carpet which the gang uses to go on adventures around the world. Some things don’t go as planned, but there are still opportunities to make others happy.</p>
			<p>As a female British author of children stories, E. Nesbit was not a typical early 20th century woman. Described as tomboy during her childhood, she grew up a staunch supporter of democratic socialism in a time when many were crushed under poverty. She was a founding member of the Fabian Society, and dedicated herself to charity work, so much so that she almost ended up in poverty.</p>
			<p>Nesbit’s stories continue to fascinate readers. Her dry wit and respect with which she engages children ensures that adults can also enjoy her tales. Her depiction of magic—how it follows rules which must be taught or learned, and the painful consequences when they are forgotten—has influenced the works of other writers such as P. L. Travers, C. S. Lewis, and J. K. Rowling.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two children, with the aid of a magical white mole, travel into the past in search of their family’s long-lost treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">Edith Nesbit</a> was a popular children’s author of the late Victorian and early Edwardian eras in Britain. Though she was writing more than a century ago, her books nevertheless remain popular and are generally still in print.</p>
			<p><i>The House of Arden</i> was published in 1908. Like her other, perhaps better known tales, such as <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit/five-children-and-it">Five Children and It</a></i>, the story takes quite ordinary children of the time and plunges them into fantastical adventures.</p>
			<p>In this book, two children, with the interesting Saxon names of Edred and Elfrida, aged 10 and 12 respectively, discover that due to the death of a distant relative, young Edred is now Lord of Arden. The estate consists of not much more than a little money, a crumbling castle, and an attached house. An old retainer tells them of a legend regarding the Lord of Arden and a buried treasure. Naturally they are eager to locate the treasure, which may help them restore the castle. They discover a way to summon up the mascot of the House, a white mole or “mouldiwarp,” who enables them to travel back through time in search of the treasure.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three children discover a wonderful garden and castle, and come into possession of a magic ring which entangles them in many strange adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Enchanted Castle</i> is a novel for young readers by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">Edith Nesbit</a>, who was writing in the late Victorian and early Edwardian era in Britain. As in her other children’s books, it begins in the everyday world but quickly brings in the fantastical and magical. A large part of the delight of Nesbit’s books is that her children behave in quite ordinary ways, getting into scrapes, getting dirty and their clothes torn, making decisions which seem right to them at the time but which are generally wrong-headed. It’s the contrast between the ordinariness of the children and the magical adventures they become involved in which makes the books so charming.</p>
			<p><i>The Enchanted Castle</i> was originally serialized in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> alongside stories by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>. The first book edition was published in 1907.</p>
			<p>In the story, Kathleen and her brothers Gerald and Jimmy find a way into a remarkable garden designed to create a Palladian landscape, full of statues and pseudo-Classical temples and buildings. It is not long before they come across a sleeping Princess. They wake her, and she introduces them to an item of real magical value, a ring which makes its wearer invisible. But once on, the ring won’t come off! “Those of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible companion will not need to be told how awkward the whole business is,” comments the author, which is indicative of the simple and direct language she uses, and the humor of the books. Even the invisibility ring, however, is not quite as simple as it seems; and many interesting and amusing adventures follow.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor orphan boy accidentally discovers magic which sends him into the past and leads to his recovery of a fortune and a lordly title.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Harding’s Luck</i>, published in 1909, is the sequel to <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit/the-house-of-arden">The House of Arden</a></i> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">E. Nesbit</a>.</p>
			<p>Rather darker and more serious in tone than the previous book, this novel is set in England’s Edwardian era, when there was no government-supported welfare and the poor still sometimes starved to death. It centers on young Dickie Harding, a poor, lame orphan boy who is enticed to run away with a disreputable tramp, Mr. Beale. Beale intends to use him to help carry out burglaries (a plot device not dissimilar to that of <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/oliver-twist">Oliver Twist</a>)</i>. Nevertheless Beale becomes a substitute father-figure to Dickie and a strong mutual affection develops.</p>
			<p>The story then introduces a magical device which sends Dickie back in time to the early reign of King James I, where he inhabits the body of the son of the lord of a castle. Despite this new, very comfortable existence, where he is a member of a rich, respected family and no longer lame, Dickie selflessly forces himself to return to his present day because of a promise he had made to Beale and a desire to help Beale lead a more honest life.</p>
			<p>Nesbit was a member of the socially-progressive Fabian Society and a friend of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells">H. G. Wells</a>, and it shows in her stories. While <i>Harding’s Luck</i> is primarily a children’s novel, it touches on many deeper themes and comments seriously on the social conditions of the author’s time.</p>

		<summary type="text">Five children encounter an ancient magical creature who grants them wishes—all of which go comically wrong.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Initially published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, which explains its episodic nature, <i>Five Children and It</i> was later collected into a book. Like many of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit">E. Nesbit’s</a> works, it has proven popular with children and adults to this day. It has been adapted into a TV series, a musical, a film, and even an anime series.</p>
			<p>In this story, five siblings encounter an ancient magical creature in a gravel pit. The Psammead, as it calls itself, grants each of them a wish per day, with the restriction that it ends at sunset. As expected, all of the children’s wishes go comically wrong, and it’s up to them to solve the problems they created.</p>
			<p>E. Nesbit’s enduring popularity is due in large part to the way she addresses children. Like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll">Lewis Carrol</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kenneth-grahame">Kenneth Grahame</a>, she engages children seriously, tapping into their imagination without any condescension. C. S. Lewis admired her, and the grumpy (but kind) sand-sorcerer Psamathos in <i>Roverandom</i>, a story J. R. R. Tolkien wrote for his own children, bears a striking resemblance to the Psammead—indeed, an early version of the story featured the creature itself!</p>

		<summary type="text">A wooden puppet comes to life and goes on adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Adventures of Pinocchio</i> is a story that has reached many people across the globe since it was first penned by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/carlo-collodi">Carlo Collodi</a> in 1883. The adventures were originally published in serial format in an Italian weekly magazine for children. In 1940, Disney released an animated film adaptation of the story that has solidified the fable in popular culture.</p>
			<p>A wooden puppet is crafted out of a magical piece of wood by Geppetto, a humble woodworker. To Geppetto’s surprise, the puppet comes to life. Thus begins the adventures of this magical puppet, Pinocchio. Geppetto takes the role of father to Pinocchio, and tries to stress the importance of his education. Pinocchio, however, is drawn into many mischievous adventures by his peers and others.</p>

		<summary type="text">A memoir narrated by a horse whose idyllic time on an English farm prepares him for a life filled with constant change and varied circumstances.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The best-selling novel <i>Black Beauty</i> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anna-sewell">Anna Sewell</a> was published in 1877. The story is a first person narrative told from the perspective of the horse Black Beauty. This unique narrative perspective enables readers to empathize with the lives of working horses and to reflect upon the cruel treatment that has been inflicted upon them. As a result, the novel serves as a strenuous and timeless statement against animal cruelty and exploitation.</p>

		<summary type="text">A father tells stories to his son about the son’s stuffed animals come to life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Winnie-the-Pooh is a bear that likes honey perhaps a little too much and lives in the Hundred Acre Wood with his animal friends Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, Eeyore, Kanga, and Roo, as well as his people friend Christopher Robin. <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> contains several stories of adventures involving Pooh and his friends, including a birthday party, looking for heffalumps, finding a missing tail, and playing a trick on one of their own. Most of them, of course, also involve honey in one way or another.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/a-a-milne">A. A. Milne</a> wrote for <i>Punch</i> magazine, authored a detective novel (<i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/a-a-milne/the-red-house-mystery">The Red House Mystery</a></i>), and published several plays, but all of them were largely forgotten after he began writing children’s books about his son’s stuffed toys. Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends captured the public’s imagination, and though Milne was only to publish four books of their adventures, they have lived on in the imagination of children ever since.</p>

		<summary type="text">Seneca’s dialogues and consolations, including “On Benefits,” examine living life through the lens of Stoic philosophy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/seneca">Seneca the Younger</a> was a statesman and philosopher who lived in Rome around the dawn of the Common Era. Though he wrote a large amount of tragedies and other works, today he’s perhaps best known for his writing on Stoic philosophy and principles.</p>
			<p>Seneca didn’t write books about Stoicism; rather, he composed essays and sent letters over the course of his lifetime that addressed that philosophy. Since these essays and letters are addressed to his friends and contemporaries, they’re written in a conversational style, and thus referred to as his “Dialogues.” Some were written to friends on the death of their loved ones, in an effort to console and comfort them. Others were written to help friends with their personality flaws, like anger. One, “On Clemency,” was addressed to the emperor Nero as an effort to guide him on the path of good statesmanship.</p>
			<p>This collection contains all of his dialogues, including the longer “On Benefits.”</p>

		<summary type="text">An English gentleman gives his best as an officer during World War I, while struggling with his scandalous wife, the incompetence of the army, and the brutality of war.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>No More Parades</i> is the second in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford">Ford Madox Ford’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/parades-end">Parade’s End</a> series. The book, released just a few years after the close of the war, is based on Ford’s combat experiences as an enlisted man in World War I, and continues the story first begun in <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford/some-do-not">Some Do Not …</a></i>.</p>
			<p>Christopher Tietjens, after recovering from the shell shock he suffered in <i>Some Do Not …</i>, has returned to the edge of the war as a commanding officer in charge of preparing draft troops for deployment to the front. As the “last true Tory,” Tietjens demonstrates talent bordering on genius as he struggles against the laziness, incompetence, and confusion of the army around him—but his troubles only begin when his self-centered and scandalous wife Sylvia appears at his base in Rouen for a surprise visit.</p>
			<p>Unlike <i>Some Do Not …</i>, which was told in a highly modernist series of flash-backs and flash-forwards, <i>Parade’s End</i> is a much more straightforward narrative. Despite this, the characters continue to be realized in an incredibly complex and nuanced way. Tietjens, almost a caricature of the stiff, honorable English gentleman, stoically absorbs the problems and suffering of those around him. Ford simultaneously paints him as an almost Christlike character and an immature, idealistic schoolboy, eager to keep up appearances despite the ruination it causes the people around him. Sylvia, his wife, has had her affairs and scandals, and is clearly a selfish and trying personality; but her powerful charm, and her frustration with both her almost comically stiff-lipped husband and the war’s interruption of civilization, lends her a not-unsympathetic air. The supporting cast of conscripts and officers is equally well-realized, with each one protraying a separate aspect of war’s effect on regular, scared people simply doing their best.</p>
			<p>The novel was extremely well-reviewed in its time, and it and the series it’s a part of remain one of the most important novels written about World War I.</p>

		<summary type="text">In the early part of the 19th Century, two young women struggle in different ways for independence and love during turbulent times caused by the advent of mechanical looms in the textile industry.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Shirley</i>, published in 1849, was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-bronte">Charlotte Brontë’s</a> second novel after <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-bronte/jane-eyre">Jane Eyre</a></i>. Published under her pseudonym of “Currer Bell,” it differs in several respects from that earlier work. It is written in the third person with an omniscient narrator, rather than the first-person of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and incorporates the themes of industrial change and the plight of unemployed workers. It also features strong pleas for the recognition of women’s intellect and right to their independence of thought and action.</p>
			<p>Set in the West Riding of Yorkshire during the Napoleonic period of the early 19th Century, the novel describes the confrontations between textile manufacturers and organized groups of workers protesting the introduction of mechanical looms. Three characters stand out: Robert Moore, a mill-owner determined to introduce modern methods despite sometimes violent opposition; his young cousin Caroline Helstone, who falls deeply in love with Robert; and Shirley Keeldar, a rich heiress who comes to live in the estate of Fieldhead, on whose land Robert’s mill stands. Robert’s business is in trouble, not so much because of the protests of the workers but because of a government decree which prevents him selling his finished cloth overseas during the duration of the war with Napoleon. He receives a loan from Miss Keeldar, and her interest in him seems to be becoming a romantic one, much to the distress of Caroline, who pines away for lack of any sign of affection from Robert.</p>
			<p>Shirley Keeldar is a remarkable female character for the time: strong, very independent-minded, dismissive of much of the standard rules of society, and determined to decide on her own future. Interestingly, up to this point, the name “Shirley” was almost entirely a male name; Shirley’s parents had hoped for a boy. Such was the success of Brontë’s novel, however, that it became increasingly popular as a female name and is now almost exclusively so.</p>
			<p>Although never as popular or successful as the more classically romantic <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Shirley</i> is nevertheless now highly regarded by critics.</p>

		<summary type="text">Four musketeers are drawn back together by current events after many years apart, try to save Charles I from Cromwell, and are pursued by the now-grown son of a former female adversary.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Twenty years after Aramis, Athos, Porthos, and d’Artagnan went their separate ways, the new cardinal, Mazarin, asks d’Artagnan to find his three friends and enlist them to help Mazarin during the Fronde civil war. Only Porthos accepts, and the four musketeers soon find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. This cannot, of course, last very long, and they ultimately join forces in England to try to rescue Charles I from Cromwell. Along the way, they are discovered and pursued by the son of Milady, their diabolical female adversary from <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas/the-three-musketeers/william-robson">The Three Musketeers</a></i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A dispute over inheritance between father and son escalates into a family feud.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Dmitri Karamazov and his father Fyodor are at war over both Dmitri’s inheritance and the affections of the beautiful Grushenka. Into this feud arrive the middle brother Ivan, recently returned from Moscow, and the youngest sibling Alyosha, who has been released into the wider world from the local monastery by the elder monk Zossima. Through a series of accidents of fate and wilful misunderstandings the Karamazovs edge closer to tragedy, while the local townspeople watch on.</p>
			<p><i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky’s</a> final novel, and was originally serialised in <i>The Russian Messenger</i> before being published as a complete novel in 1880. This edition is the well-received 1912 English translation by Constance Garnett. As well as earning wide-spread critical acclaim, the novel has been widely influential in literary and philosophical circles; Franz Kafka and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">James Joyce</a> admired the emotions that verge on madness in the Karamazovs, while Sigmund Freud and Jean-Paul Satre found inspiration in the themes of patricide and existentialism.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two poor Russian people exchange letters of love, hope and fear.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1840s <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg the ageing copyist Makar Dievushkin is, with various degrees of subtlety, trying to woo Barbara Dobroselova, a young woman who has had a swift fall in fortunes. Told in alternating letters to each other, their past stories and current hopes play out in raw and personal detail, as the daily realities of an uncaring and expensive town take hold.</p>
			<p><i>Poor Folk</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky’s</a> first novel and was written to try and cover his escalating debts from his expensive lifestyle and gambling addiction. Luckily for Dostoevsky, it was an immediate success when it was published in the <i><abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg Collection</i>, and the accolades from critics such as Belinsky and Herzen propelled him into the high echelons of Russian literary society. This edition is the 1915 translation by <abbr>C. J.</abbr> Hogarth.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man living alone in St. Petersburg writes memoirs describing his alienation from modern society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Notes from Underground</i> is a fictional collection of memoirs written by a civil servant living alone in <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg. The man is never named and is generally referred to as the Underground Man. The “underground” in the book refers to the narrator’s isolation, which he described in chapter 11 as “listening through a crack under the floor.”</p>
			<p>It is considered to be one of the first existentialist novels. With this book, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a> challenged the ideologies of his time, like nihilism and utopianism. The Underground Man shows how idealized rationality in utopias is inherently flawed, because it doesn’t account for the irrational side of humanity.</p>
			<p>This novel has had a big impact on many different works of literature and philosophy. It has influenced writers like Franz Kafka and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. A similar character is also found in Martin Scorsese’s <i>Taxi Driver</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Notes from Underground</i> was published in 1864 as the first four issues of <i>Epoch</i>, a Russian magazine by Fyodor and Mikhail Dostoevsky. Presented here is Constance Garnett’s translation from 1918.</p>

		<summary type="text">Inflated by his own ambition, Raskolnikov murders a pawnbroker then faces the inevitable consequences.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Crime and Punishment</i> tells the story of Rodion Raskolnikov, an ex-student who plans to murder a pawnbroker to test his theory of personality. Having accomplished the deed, Raskolnikov struggles with mental anguish while trying to both avoid the consequences and hide his guilt from his friends and family.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Dostoevsky’s</a> original idea for the novel centered on the Marmeladov family and the impact of alcoholism in Russia, but inspired by a double murder in France he decided to rework it around the new character of Raskolnikov. The novel was first serialized in <i>The Russian Messenger</i> over the course of 1866, where it was an instant success. It was published in a single volume in 1867. Presented here is Constance Garnett’s 1914 translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">After ten years spent in solitude, Zarathustra goes back amongst men to share his accumulated wisdom and prepare humanity for the Overman.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche’s</a> favorite of the books he wrote, and has been his most popular amongst general readers. Yet some scholars dislike it because of its unphilosophical nature: it eschews jargon and the scaffolding of arguments, which engage only the intellect, in favor of an artistic approach that engages the whole mind.</p>
			<p>After ten years of solitude in a cave high in the mountains, Zarathustra wishes to share with humanity the wisdom he has accumulated during this time. He reaches the nearest town and addresses the crowd on the marketplace. He tells them of the Overman: the next step in human evolution, a being who creates their own values, freed from the weight of tradition and morality, and who takes responsibility for their own successes and failures. But the crowd doesn’t understand him; his discourse is met only with rude ignorance. Zarathustra then decides to gather a small group of disciples and share his wisdom with them.</p>
			<p>The bulk of the book is Zarathustra’s speeches on topics such as morality, society, individualism, religion, and how suffering and its overcoming are what give meaning to our existence. While already wiser than most, Zarathustra still learns from those he talks to, re-evaluating his thoughts as he deals with disappointment (such as when his disciples prove to be mere followers), and confronting his own doubts. His greatest challenge, though, comes when he faces the existential test of the eternal recurrence of the same: the thought that our lives could repeat indefinitely without the minutest of change.</p>
			<p>The inspiration for <i>Zarathustra</i> came to Nietzsche during one of the long hikes he often indulged in despite his failing health. It was a decade of solitude: his physical condition had worsened to the point of forcing him to retire from his position at the University of Basel, and each change of season prompted him to relocate to kinder climes in Switzerland, France, or Italy. The book took two years to write. Each of its four parts was written in a ten-day period of creative effervescence followed by months of gloom, plagued by terrible, debilitating migraines.</p>
			<p><i>Zarathustra</i> was initially received with indifference at best and frustration at worst. It’s a work of philosophy as much as aesthetics: the language is modeled after the Luther Bible and contains numerous references to Homer, Heraclitus, Plato, Goethe, Emerson, and Wagner, to name a few. Later Nietzsche attempted to address the book’s lack of popularity by framing the same concepts in a more traditional, approachable manner in his following book, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche/beyond-good-and-evil/helen-zimmern"><i>Beyond Good and Evil</i></a>, but that book also struggled to find an audience.</p>
			<p>With his health steadily deteriorating, Nietzsche’s mind broke down in 1889 and never recovered. His body would live on for 11 more years, and he ended up in the care of his sister, Elisabeth. A stalwart nationalist and anti-Semite, she saw in her brother’s illness the opportunity to turn him into a German hero. Despite her brother’s firm opposition to nationalism, anti-Semitism, and power politics, she perverted his work by promoting it for her own ends. Scores of commentators partook in her lie and enthusiastically used Nietzsche’s work to buttress their own contrary views. Doing so requires one to selectively ignore half the content of the book: Zarathustra’s discourses regularly touch on <i>a priori</i> dark and violent themes, but they also clearly state that these are to be directed towards oneself. Reaching the Overman requires us to know ourselves, and such introspection, given the darker side of human nature, leads to contempt. This contempt for ourselves, says Nietzsche, should be embraced as the first step towards awareness of what we could be. Cruelty, likewise, stems from that knowledge as a necessity to hammer ourselves into the proper shape. Such commentators also conveniently ignored Zarathustra’s many remarks about love: love for ourselves, he says, is what can prevent us from spreading resentment around us during this difficult process of change.</p>
			<p>The first English translation of <i>Zarathustra</i> was by Alexander Tille, a German scholar who had emigrated to Scotland. English wasn’t his first language and his work suffered from it. Thomas Common, a Scottish scholar, used Tille’s work as the base for his own translation. Bringing <i>Zarathustra</i> to the English-speaking world was no easy task given Nietzsche’s stylistic idiosyncrasies. Just like Nietzsche, Common took risks: because the book is written in the style of the Luther Bible, Common decided to emulate the style of the King James Bible; he also tried to reproduce the musicality of the language and the new words coined by Nietzsche, some of which have been updated over time—e.g. Common’s “Superman” is nowadays known as “Overman.” While his choices have been controversial, he produced a landmark translation that faithfully tried to convert the unique flavor of <i>Zarathustra</i> into English. Published in 1909, it would take four decades until the next translation by Walter Kaufman in 1954.</p>
			<p>But <i>Zarathustra</i> didn’t find its scholarly fame limited to Europe: soon after its publication, it reached Asia, where it was received with enthusiasm, particularly in China and Japan where it influenced the famous Kyoto School. <i>Zarathustra</i> has also received special attention from the music world. Nietzsche loved music and poetry, and it was his wish that this book be taken as music. No fewer than 87 pieces have been inspired by the book, in part or as a whole. The best known are Richard Strauss’ <i>Also Sprach Zarathustra</i>, the fourth movement of Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, and Frederick Delius’ <i>A Mass of Life</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A British wine merchant on business in France stumbles across a syndicate with something to hide, and resolves to discover their secret.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Pit-Prop Syndicate</i> is a story from the beginning of the golden age of crime fiction. Seymour Merriman, a British wine merchant on business in France, happens upon a syndicate manufacturing pit-props—beams used to prop up mine tunnels—but his eye is caught by one odd detail: their lorry’s numberplate mysteriously changes. With the help of his friend Hilliard from the Excise department they dig deeper and uncover a dangerous conspiracy.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/freeman-wills-crofts">Freeman Wills Crofts</a> was a civil engineer, turned author of crime fiction. Though somewhat forgotten today, his style was widely appreciated at the time, and still finds fans of those who like a puzzle where all the loose ends are tied up. During his career he wrote over thirty crime novels; <i>The Pit-Prop Syndicate</i>, published in 1922, was his third.</p>

		<summary type="text">Frederick Douglass describes his youth as a slave in Maryland and his desire to be a free man.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</i> was written in 1845, seven years after <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/frederick-douglass">Douglass</a> escaped slavery, and is the first of three autobiographies. It covers his life as a slave, enduring the whips of the overseers and the hopelessness of his circumstances, until his escape to the north and arrival at New Bedford, Massachusetts. The brutalities he witnessed and his slowly growing desire for freedom are presented in the vivid language he was already known for in his antislavery oration.</p>
			<p>The eloquence of Douglass’s speeches caused some skeptics to doubt his credibility, believing that a former slave with no education could never speak so well. Thus, part of his motivation for writing the book was to dispel this suspicion and to provide a fuller history than was possible in his lectures. The abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips provided introductions vouching for the truth of Douglass’s words.</p>
			<p>The book was an immediate best seller. The fame brought danger to Douglass, who sailed for England shortly after the book’s publication to ensure he would not be apprehended as a fugitive slave. He spent two years touring and lecturing in Great Britain and Ireland before returning to America to continue his abolitionist work. English supporters raised funds to purchase his freedom from his former master.</p>
			<p>The slave narrative is an autobiographical genre written by escaped slaves concerning their lives in bondage. Slave narratives not only promoted abolitionism by giving first hand evidence of the cruelty and hypocrisy of slaveholders, but also allowed African Americans to express themselves as intelligent, articulate individuals, deserving of respect and freedom. Douglass’s <i>Narrative</i> is perhaps the most important example of the genre, on the basis of its literary merits and its impact on the abolitionist movement.</p>

		<summary type="text">A San Francisco dentist and his wife descend into avarice, obsession, and violence.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>McTeague is an enormously strong but dim-witted former miner now working as a dentist in San Francisco towards the end of the nineteenth century. He falls in love with Trina, one of his patients, and shortly after their engagement she wins a large sum in a lottery. All is well until McTeague is betrayed and they fall into a life of increasing poverty and degradation.</p>
			<p>This novel is often presented as an example of American naturalism where the behavior and experience of characters are constrained by “nature”—both their own heredity nature, and the broader social environment.</p>
			<p>McTeague was published in 1899 as the first of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/frank-norris">Norris’s</a> major novels.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of a swindler in 17th-century Spain.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/francisco-de-quevedo">Francisco de Quevedo</a> holds the status of a man-of-letters in the same pantheon as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/miguel-de-cervantes-saavedra">Cervantes</a>; but despite that, <i>Pablo de Segovia</i> is his only novel. Quevedo had circulated the manuscript privately for several years before it was published in 1626 without his permission. The novel is partly a satire of contemporary Spanish life, and a caricature of the various social strata Pablo encounters and emulates.</p>
			<p>Pablo himself is a low-born person who aspires to become a gentleman, but despite his best efforts he repeatedly fails and is eventually forced to become a “sharper,” or rogue. His failures give Quevedo an avenue to expound on his belief that attempting to break past your social class can only lead to disorder; and that despite one’s best efforts, bettering oneself is largely impossible. Pablo’s stumbling from misfortune to misfortune is a farce that helped cement Quevedo’s reputation as a literary giant.</p>

		<summary type="text">As the Civil War rages, a young woman living the North is unaware of her African ancestry until she returns to the South and is immediately enslaved.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>As the Civil War bears down on a small North Carolina town, a tight-knit community of enslaved men and women is preparing for the coming battle and the possibility of freedom. Into this ensemble cast of characters comes Iola Leroy, a young woman who grew up unaware of her African ancestry until she is lured back home under false pretenses and immediately enslaved. Amidst a backdrop of battlefield hospitals and clandestine prayer meetings, this quietly stouthearted novel is a story of community, integrity, and solidarity.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/frances-ellen-watkins-harper">Frances Ellen Watkins Harper</a> was already one of the most prominent African-American poets of the nineteenth century when—at age 67—she turned her focus to novels. Her most enduring work, <i>Iola Leroy</i>, was one of the first novels published by an African-American writer. Although the book was initially popular with readers, it soon fell out of print and was critically forgotten. In the 1970s, the book was rediscovered and reclaimed as a seminal contribution to African-American literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">The friendship between two well-heeled couples is a veneer over darker truths.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the height of <i lang="fr">belle époque</i> Europe, an American couple—the narrator John Dowell and his wife Florence–and a British couple–Leonora and the titular “good soldier” Edward Ashburnham—meet and become firm friends. Travelling and socialising together, it’s a full nine years before the cracks start to show, but when they do the whole edifice starts tumbling to reveal the secrecy and lies concealed within.</p>
			<p><i>The Good Soldier</i> is a classic example of the unreliable narrator genre. With a charitable view, everything John Dowell retells is plausible, but it doesn’t take much critical thinking to reframe the story’s events as something entirely more sinister.</p>
			<p>The novel is now frequently ranked by critics as one of the great pieces of twentieth-century literature. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, already published many times over by this novel’s release, and along with collaborations with both <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> and Ernest Hemingway, went on to create and edit the influential literature journals <i>The English Review</i> and <i>The Transatlantic Review</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">As World War I looms, a stiff English statistician and a suffragette fall in love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Some Do Not …</i> opens at the cusp of World War I. Christopher Tietjens, a government statistician, and his friend Vincent Macmaster, an aspiring literary critic, are visiting the English countryside. Tietjens, preoccupied with his disastrous marriage, meets Valentine Wannop, a suffragette, during a round of golf. As their love story develops, the novel explores the horrors of the war without the narrative ever entering the battlefield.</p>
			<p>The characters are complex and nuanced. Tietjens is an old-fashioned man even by the standards of his day; he’s concerned with honor and doing the right thing, but he lives in a society that only pays those values lip service. Yet he himself isn’t free of a thread of hypocrisy: he won’t leave his deeply unhappy marriage because that would be the wrong way to act, but the reader is left wondering if he tolerates his situation simply because he married up in class. He wants to do to the noble and right thing, but does that mean going to war?</p>
			<p>The men and women around him each have their individual motivations, and they are often conniving and unlikable in their aspirations even as the propaganda of England at war paints the country as a moral and heroic one. The delicate interplay of each character’s subtleties paints a rich portrait of 1920s English society, as the romantic ideals of right and wrong clash with notions of ambition and practicality.</p>
			<p>The prose is unapologetically modernist: unannounced time shifts combine with a stream-of-consciousness style that can often be dense. Yet <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford">Ford’s</a> portrayal of shell shock, the politics of women in the 1920s, and the moral greyness of wartime is groundbreaking. The book, and its complete tetralogy—called <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/parades-end">Parade’s End</a>—has garnered praise from critics and authors alike, with Anthony Burgess calling it “the finest novel about the First World War” and William Carlos Williams stating that the novels “constitute the English prose masterpiece of their time.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A veteran returning from the front celebrates Armistice Day with the people he loves, while trying to deal with the psychological impacts of war.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Man Could Stand Up—</i> opens on Armistice Day, with Valentine Wannop learning that her love, Christopher Tietjens, has returned to London from the front. As she prepares to meet him, the narrative suddenly shifts time and place to earlier in the year, with Tietjens commanding a group of soldiers in a trench somewhere in the war zone. Tietjens leads his company bravely as they shelter from the constant German strafes, before the narrative again jumps to conclude with an actual Armistice Day celebration.</p>
			<p>In this simple narrative <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford">Ford</a> creates dense, complex character studies of Valentine and Tietjens. Tietjens, often called “the last Tory” for his staunch and unwavering approach to honor, duty, and fidelity, has changed greatly from the man he was in the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/parades-end">previous installments in the series</a>. Ford explores the psychological horror that the Great War inflicted on its combatants through the lens of Valentine’s gentle curiosity about Tietjen’s time on the front: men returned from battle injured not just in body, but in soul, too. The constant, unrelenting shelling, the endless strafes, the clouds of poison gas, the instant death of friends and comrades for no reason at all, the muddy and grim entrenchments where men lived and died—all of these permanently changed soldiers in ways that previous wars didn’t. Now the “last Tory” wants nothing more than to retreat from society and live a quiet life with the woman he loves—who is not his wife.</p>
			<p>As we follow Valentine and Tietjens through the last day of the war, we see how the Great War was not just the destruction of men, but of an entire era.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man is found dead in a hansom cab in the city of Melbourne, Australia, and a young man is accused of his murder.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i>, published in 1886, was the first novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fergus-hume">Fergus Hume</a>. It begins with a sensational murder, as the body of a dead man is discovered in a hansom cab by the driver. Set in Melbourne, Australia, it presents an engaging story of crime and detection, with several unexpected twists and turns. It also gives a clear and interesting portrait of the colonial city at the peak of its 19th Century prosperity following a gold rush, a time when it was known as “Marvellous Melbourne.” The novel contrasts the comfortable lives of the rich and well-connected of the colony with the misery of those living in the noisome slums in the back-streets of the city.</p>
			<p>The novel, originally published in serial form in a local newspaper, achieved some initial local success when it was first released in book form, but the author then sold the rights to a British company.</p>
			<p>After warm initial reviews in England <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i> became not merely a best-seller but what today we would call a “blockbuster” in the United Kingdom, its English-speaking colonies and the United States. It was the best-selling mystery novel of the Victorian era, and apparently was part of the inspiration for Conan Doyle to begin writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>
			<p>Fergus Hume eventually left Australia and returned to England. Though little-known today, after the success of <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i> Hume went on to write more than a hundred additional novels in the crime genre, as well as several plays.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man comes of age during America’s Jazz Age.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>This Side of Paradise</i> chronicles the coming of age of Amory Blaine, born to a wealthy midwestern family. It begins with Amory as a spoiled youth, doted on by his eccentric mother Beatrice. It follows him as he attends preparatory school and Princeton, and then briefly attempts but quickly abandons at a career in advertising. His service in World War I is mentioned but mostly glossed over. Covered in much more detail are his various romances: youthful dalliances, a correspondence-based relationship that ends as soon as the couple spends time together in person, a deep love with the debutante sister of one of his close friends, and an intense summer fling.</p>
			<p>The book shows Amory’s attempts to define himself as a person and find his place in a world rapidly changing through World War, the “Jazz Age,” and Prohibition. It provides the reader with a good picture of what life was like for a privileged young man of the era.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald"><abbr>F.</abbr> Scott Fitzgerald’s</a> first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i> was published in 1920 when he was 23 years old, and was widely praised by critics. The semi-autobiographical work launched his career as one of America’s most well-known writers. As a direct result of the publishing of the novel, Zelda Sayre (the inspiration for the character of the debutante Rosalind Connage) agreed to marry Fitzgerald. The couple became an icon of the excesses of the Jazz Age.</p>

		<summary type="text">The decadent and mysterious Jay Gatsby pursues the American Dream in Jazz Age New York.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Great Gatsby</i> is a novel that needs no introduction for a certain generation of American readers. Long taught as required reading in American schools, critics have consistently held it up alongside <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville/moby-dick">Moby Dick</a></i>, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn">Huck Finn</a></i>, and <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> as perhaps the quintessential Great American Novel.</p>
			<p>Nick Carraway is a young Midwestern man freshly arrived in New York to make his fortune. He rents a shabby apartment in Long Island next door to a sumptuous mansion: the home of the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby. Carraway spends time catching up with his distant cousin Daisy and her industry-baron husband Tom before being invited to one of Gatsby’s wildly lavish weekend parties. There he meets Jordan, a flapper and a golf star, and an intricate web of romances and betrayals begins to unfold.</p>
			<p>The novel is a colorful study of America’s Jazz Age—a term said to be coined by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald">Fitzgerald</a> himself—complete with wealthy socialites living in hedonistic abandon, libertine flappers, jazz bands, roaring roadsters, and greasy speakeasies populated with shady grifters. Contrasted against the glamorous lives of wealthy socialites is the entrenched lower class, who live in gray, dingy squalor among smoldering ash-heaps. Fitzgerald uses the setting to examine the American Dream: the idea that anyone in America can achieve success through hard work and dedication. Gatsby has spent his life reaching for his dream. Some say he’s already achieved it. But has he? Is the dream even real for the hard-working poor that Gatsby and Tom race past in their glittering cars on the way to the decadent city?</p>
			<p>Fitzgerald wrote much of his real life into the novel. Like Carraway, he was a Midwesterner educated at an Ivy-league school who went to live on Long Island. Despite his meager finances he hobnobbed with socialites, and spent his career struggling for money to maintain the grand style his romantic interests were accustomed to.</p>
			<p>The cover art, titled <i>Celestial Eyes</i>, was commissioned from Francis Cugat, who completed it before the novel was finished. The huge eyes gazing down on the blazing city so moved Fitzgerald that he wrote them into the story.</p>
			<p>Fitzgerald saw the novel as a purely artistic work, free of the pulp pandering required by his shorter commissions—but despite that, contemporary reviews were mixed, and it sold poorly. Fitzgerald thought it a failure, and died believing the novel to be fatally obscure. Only during World War II did it come back to the public consciousness, buoyed by the support of a ring of writers and critics and printed as an Armed Service Edition to be sent to soldiers on the front. Now it is an American classic.</p>

		<summary type="text">The marriage between a down-and-out aesthete and a self-indulgent flapper begins to crumble against the backdrop of World War I and America’s Jazz Age.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Anthony Patch, the grandson of a wealthy businessman, spends his youth in idle relaxation expecting to inherit his grandfather’s fortune. But when he meets Gloria, a vibrant young flapper, the two feel an irresistible attraction and quickly get married despite their clashing personalities.</p>
			<p>The two embark on a lifestyle of Jazz Age living: hard partying, profligate spending, and generally living the high life. But Anthony’s prohibitionist grandfather soon finds out and disowns Anthony, sending their lifestyle crashing down from its former heights to intolerable indignity.</p>
			<p>Like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald">Fitzgerald’s</a> previous novel, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald/this-side-of-paradise">This Side of Paradise</a></i>, and his next novel, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald/the-great-gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></i>, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> documents the life of the idle rich in America’s Jazz Age. Both Anthony and Gloria’s characters explore the problem of what one is left to do when one has no other purpose in life. Because Anthony’s expecting a large inheritance, his ambition is muzzled and he feels no need to embark on a career or participate in the betterment of society. Gloria’s main purpose in life was to find a husband; once she’s done that, what’s left except spending money and partying?</p>
			<p>The relationship between Anthony and Gloria is the explosive propellant that drives the plot. The two are clearly a poor match for each other. While Anthony is an aimless aesthete who expects to inherit wealth and power, Gloria is a self-absorbed socialite mostly banking on her undisputed beauty. Their mutual selfishness leads to constant conflict, and eventually, to mutual dislike. But despite that, the two remain together, locked in to their self-absorption, lack of ambition, and obsession with the past, as Anthony descends into alcoholism and Gloria into desperate middle age.</p>
			<p>Anthony and Gloria are fairly transparent fictionalizations of Fitzgerald himself and his wife Zelda. Their relationship was famously tumultuous, and parallels Anthony and Gloria’s highs and lows. Fitzgerald himself was born to upper-middle-class wealth and led a aimless youth before turning to the army and to writing; in his later years, he considered himself nothing more than a middling success and turned to writing for Hollywood before totally embracing the alcoholism he had courted since his college days, and that would finally kill him. Zelda, for her part, was a socialite and the canonical “flapper.” Beautiful and bubbly, she enabled the legendarily hard-partying lifestyle that fueled their bitter fights. Her mercurial disposition later led her to being committed to an asylum for schizophrenia. Even the cover illustration of the book’s first edition features a couple meant to resemble Fitzgerald and Zelda.</p>
			<p>Today, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> is not just a glittering record of Jazz Age excess, it’s a nuanced character study of how expectation can ruin ambition, and how relationships aren’t always easy to endure—or to dissolve.</p>

			<p>Khaled is a hard-working and faithful genie who, in his zeal, goes a little too far and kills a faithless man.

		<summary type="text">Evelyn Underhill makes the case that mysticism is accessible and beneficial to everyone.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Surprisingly timeless and under the guise of “Christian Mysticism,” <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/evelyn-underhill">Underhill</a> describes in 1914 what could rightly be called “secular mindfulness” today. Evelyn Underhill doesn’t use much Christian terminology, instead preferring to use words that may be considered “new age.” If one can get past the terminology, the “Practical Mysticism” allows anyone to explore the mystical aspects of their own worldview without necessarily betraying their prior deeply-held beliefs.</p>
			<p><i>Practical Mysticism</i> is not a guidebook for mystical practice, though it does provide some tips along the way. What it does give is an introduction and apology for the sufficiently motivated; those that see (or want to see) the world in a different way.</p>

		<summary type="text">An expressionist play following a brutish stoker’s dehumanization as he descends from being a leader of his fellow workers to a literal ape.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/eugene-oneill">Eugene O’Neill’s</a> <i>The Hairy Ape</i> isn’t one of his best-known works, but it has gained popularity as an exploration of early American society. It was first produced in 1922 by the Provincetown Players in Massachusetts, embracing expressionism in its set design and staging, before moving on to Broadway, where it faced resistance from local and federal governments due to its radical views.</p>
			<p>The play examines the existential crisis of the protagonist, a brutish stoker named Yank, who begins the play secure in his role as the leader of firemen on an Atlantic ocean liner. But when confronted by the disdain of an upper-class passenger who calls him a “filthy beast,” he seeks to rebel against his place. Then, as all his plans for revenge fail, he slowly finds himself descending to the literal level that society has relegated him to.</p>
			<p>O’Neill uses Yank’s search for belonging to explore the destructive forces of industrialization and social class. Early on, <i>The Hairy Ape</i>’s commentary on the dehumanization of workers caused it to be taken up by many labor groups and unions to further their own causes. The play also touches on themes of masculinity and socialism, and the repeated references to the “blackface” of the ship’s stokers and Yank’s degeneration into an animal have added a racial element to recent analyses.</p>

		<summary type="text">A clergyman turned revolutionary challenges both God and empire in the politically turbulent times of mid 19th-century Italy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Gadfly</i> is set in 1840s Italy, at a time when the country was chafing under Austrian rule. The titular character is a charming, witty writer of pointed political satires who finds himself running with a crowd of revolutionaries. The plot develops as the revolutionaries struggle against the government and as the Gadfly struggles with a mysterious hatred of the Church, and of a certain Cardinal.</p>
			<p>The novel, with its complex themes of loyalty, romance, revolution, and struggle against both establishment and religion, was very popular in its day both in its native Ireland and other countries like Russia and China. In Russia, the book was so popular that it became required reading. Since its publication it has also been adapted into film, opera, theater, and ballet, and its popularity spurred <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ethel-voynich">Voynich</a> to write sequels and prequels.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two English friends go on a sailing trip that quickly turns thrilling as they stumble upon a sinister German plot.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Riddle of the Sands</i> is one of the earliest examples of the spy novel genre, and became hugely popular shortly after its publication. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/erskine-childers">Childers</a> carefully interweaves fiction with real-world places, events, and politics, making for an extremely convincing story of invasion—so convincing that some (perhaps erroneously) credit the novel with spurring the creation of new English naval bases. The framing device, where Childers pretends to be an editor presenting a factual account, only adds to the believability of the story.</p>
			<p>The novel begins with Carruthers, an official in the Foreign Office, accepting an invitation from his friend Davies for what he assumes is a pleasure trip on a sailboat in the Baltic sea. As the two embark on their journey, it quickly becomes apparent that not everything is at it seems on the German coast.</p>
			<p><i>Riddle</i> helped energize the spy novel genre, providing a template for countless authors to come, including Ian Fleming and John le Carré, and has been adapted numerous times for film, television and radio.</p>

		<summary type="text">A British expedition sets off to cross Antarctica, but when their ship is wrecked they have to face a long struggle for survival.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>South!</i> tells one of the most thrilling tales of exploration and survival against the odds which has ever been written. It details the experiences of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition which set off in 1914 to make an attempt to cross the Antarctic continent.</p>
			<p>Under the direction of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-shackleton">Sir Ernest Shackleton</a>, the expedition comprised two components: one party sailing on the <i>Endurance</i> into the Weddell Sea, which was to attempt the actual crossing; and another party on board the <i>Aurora</i>, under the direction of Aeneas Mackintosh, sailing into the Ross Sea on the other side of the continent and tasked with establishing depots of stores as far south as possible for the use of the party attempting the crossing.</p>
			<p>Shackleton gives a highly readable account of the fate of both parties of the Expedition. Both fell victim to the severe environmental conditions of the region, and it was never possible to attempt the crossing. The <i>Endurance</i> was trapped in pack-ice in the Weddell Sea and the ship was eventually crushed by the pressure of the ice, leaving Shackleton’s men stranded on ice floes, far from solid land.</p>
			<p>Shackleton’s account of their extraordinary struggles to survive is as gripping as any novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">A jingoistic military officer embarks on a tragicomic quest to become a “perfect soldier.”</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A biting satire of late 19th-century American imperialism, <i>Captain Jinks, Hero</i> was written by the American pacifist <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-howard-crosby">Ernest Howard Crosby</a>. Crosby, who corresponded with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> and advocated Tolstoy’s pacifist ideals in the United States, lambasts the American military and its involvement in the Spanish-American War and the Boxer Rebellion through the character of Captain Jinks, a jingoistic officer who embarks on a tragicomic quest to become a “perfect soldier.” The novel also satirizes the role of industrial and media interests in promoting war through the character of Jinks’s friend and companion Cleary, a yellow journalist who feeds sensational stories back to the home front at the behest of editors and monopolists.</p>

		<summary type="text">An American expatriate socializes in Paris and Spain as one of the Lost Generation.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Sun Also Rises</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway’s</a> first published novel, and the novel that introduced the term “Lost Generation” to describe the generation that came to adulthood during World War I.</p>
			<p>The novel follows Jake Barnes, an American expat living in the Parisian café society of the roaring 20s. A wound sustained during the war has left him unable to have sex, and that drives a wedge between him and the woman he loves: Brett Ashley, a twice-divorcée who has embraced the sexual freedom and independence of the age. As they drift through their lives in postwar Paris, they find themselves on a trip with some friends to Spain to witness the Festival of San Fermin, a week-long bacchanal whose highlight is bullfighting.</p>
			<p>Hemingway explores the aimless, heavy drinking, and dramatic lives of Jake, Brett, and their friends as a means to reflect the Lost Generation as a whole. Jake is a character of troubled masculinity: his war wound has fundamentally changed him as a man, and his behavior is often tentative, unsure, and placating. On the other hand, Brett is an enigmatic New Woman: free to drink and carouse with the men, she is seductive, but aching for the reassurance and love of a real relationship, and not just sex. The satellites of friends that orbit around them are equally troubled, drinking to excess and fighting with themselves and with others.</p>
			<p>These complex characters are now mere spectators for the bullfight, a microcosm of war and death whose masters, the matadors, are the powerful and elegant emblems of masculinity that the Lost Generation finds it impossible to compete against.</p>
			<p>Though initially met with mixed reviews, modern critics consider it to be Hemingway’s best novel. The characters and events are largely based on real-life people in Hemingway’s social circle and his time spent in Paris and Spain. Thus, the book sold very well in its first print run, as the expatriate community was eager to read about the coded scandals of their peers. Today it is recognized as a foundational work of the modernist style, and an American classic.</p>

		<summary type="text">An ancient Chinese storyteller charged with treason uses his beguiling tales to avoid conviction.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-bramah">Ernest Bramah’s</a> <i>Kai Lung</i> stories are set in a fantastical ancient China and written with an oblique, ornate prose style that serves to mimic that of Chinese folk tales. The titular character is an itinerant storyteller and the books themselves are mostly collections of stories presented as if he were narrating.</p>
			<p><i>Kai Lung’s Golden Hours</i>, published in 1922, is the second of the Kai Lung books, and the first to have an overarching framing narrative and thus be published as a novel. In it we see Kai Lung brought before the court of the Mandarin Shan Tien, having been accused of treason by the Mandarin’s agent Ming-shu. Appealing to Shan Tien’s appreciation for refined narrative, Kai Lung tries to regain his freedom by spinning a series of beguiling tales filled with aphorisms and humorous understatement.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Epictetus’s short works.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Born enslaved and lamed by his master, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus">Epictetus</a> studied Stoic philosophy while in bondage. Once freed, he survived Domitian’s banishment of all philosophers from Rome to settle in Greece, where he founded a school of philosophy. He quickly rose to prominence as a renowned Stoic scholar and teacher, and even though he was personally favored by emperors, he kept a simple life.</p>
			<p>While most of Epictetus’s writings were compiled in the <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/discourses/george-long">Discourses</a></i> by his student Arrian of Nicomedia, his writings were also summarized in a short manual called the “Enchiridion.” A short handbook with practical suggestions on how to live a good and satisfying life, it remained popular for centuries with translations to different languages completed as early as 1493, and was even a common school text in Scotland during the 18th century.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition collects the “Enchiridion” together with Epictetus’s miscellaneous fragmentary teachings.</p>

		<summary type="text">Epictetus instructs his students how to live the life of a Stoic.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Raised a slave in Nero’s court, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus">Epictetus</a> would become one of the most influential philosophers in the Stoic tradition. While exiled in Greece by an emperor who considered philosophers a threat, Epictetus founded a school of philosophy at Nicopolis. His student Arrian of Nicomedia took careful notes of his sometimes cantankerous lectures, the surviving examples of which are now known as the <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>.</p>
			<p>In these discourses, Epictetus explains how to gain peace-of-mind by only willing that which is within the domain of your will. There is no point in getting upset about things that are outside of your control; that only leads to distress. Instead, let such things be however they are, and focus your effort on the things that are in your control: your own attitudes and priorities. This way, you can never be thrown off balance, and tranquility is yours for the taking.</p>
			<p>The lessons in the <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>, along with his <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/the-enchiridion/elizabeth-carter">Enchiridion</a></i>, have continued to attract new adherents to Stoic philosophy down to the present day.</p>

		<summary type="text">Emma Goldman recounts her experiences living in the early Soviet Union.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1919, at the height of the anti-leftist Palmer Raids conducted by the Wilson administration, the anarchist activist and writer <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emma-goldman">Emma Goldman</a> was deported to the nascent Soviet Union. Despite initial plans to fight the deportation order in court, Goldman eventually acquiesced in order to take part in the new revolutionary Russia herself. While initially supportive of the Bolsheviks, with some reservations, Goldman’s firsthand experiences with Bolshevik oppression and corruption prompted her titular disillusionment and eventual emigration to Germany.</p>
			<p>In <i>My Disillusionment in Russia</i>, Goldman records her travels throughout Russia as part of a revolutionary museum commission, and her interactions with a variety of political and literary figures like Vladimir Lenin, Maxim Gorky, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-reed">John Reed</a>, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/peter-kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>. Goldman concludes her account with a critique of the Bolshevik ideology in which she asserts that revolutionary change in institutions cannot take place without corresponding changes in values.</p>
			<p><i>My Disillusionment in Russia</i> had a troubled publication history, since the first American printing in 1923 omitted the last twelve chapters of what was supposed to be a thirty-three chapter book. (Somehow, the last chapters failed to reach the publisher, who did not suspect the book to be incomplete.) The situation was remedied with the publication of the remaining chapters in 1924 as part of a volume titled <i>My Further Disillusionment in Russia</i>. This Standard Ebooks edition compiles both volumes into a single volume, following the intent of the original manuscript.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adopted child ends up tearing apart families in a quest for power and revenge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Returning from Liverpool, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Earnshaw brings with him a dirty, ragged, black-haired child called Heathcliff, and sets into motion a tale of destructive passions. The book’s two locations, the genteel Thrushcross Grange and the wild Wuthering Heights, serve as matching backgrounds to the characters of their occupants, as they struggle to gain the upper hand in marriage and power. All the while, the ghosts of the past seem to drive revenge more than inspire forgiveness.</p>
			<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emily-bronte">Emily Brontë’s</a> sole published novel before her early death at the age of 30. Published under the pen name of Ellis Bell, a shared surname with the pen names of her sisters, many assumed that such a book could only have been written by a man. Reviewers of the time praised its emotional power but were also shocked at the actions of its characters, and most agreed that it was impossible to put down. After the novel’s original publication in 1847 it was revised into a single volume in 1850, and over time has become a classic of English literature. The story has been reworked into plays, operas, films, TV dramatisations and a ballet, and has inspired many further works of art, music and literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A groundbreaking painter struggles to leave his mark on the bohemian art world of 19th-century Paris.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>His Masterpiece</i>, sometimes translated as “The Work” or “The Masterpiece,” is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-zola">Zola’s</a> 14th entry in his Rougon-Macquart series of novels. In it we see Claude Lantier, a painter with obvious talent, struggle to leave a revolutionary mark on the art world of 19th-century Paris. The novel deftly explores the themes of genius, poverty, purity in art, art as a bureaucratic institution, obsession, and madness.</p>
			<p>The book is notable not just for its accurate portrayal of the art world of the time, but also for the interesting personal details Zola incorporated into the book. Lantier is a pastiche of several famous painters Zola personally knew, including Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, and Édouard Manet; Lantier’s masterpiece is based on Manet’s revolutionary painting <i>Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe</i>; and the novel’s accuracy is even blamed on ending the long friendship between Zola and Cézanne. Zola himself includes a self-portrait, as the character Pierre Sandoz.</p>
			<p>Vizetelly’s translation is fresh and readable, and Zola’s rendition of Paris and the surrounding countryside is vibrant and engrossing. Rarely do we get such a close and engaging window into bohemian life in old Paris.</p>

		<summary type="text">A new resident of a poor coal mining town in 1860s France begins learning about socialist principles, and convinces the town to go on strike.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Germinal</i>, named after the spring month in the French Republican Calendar, is often considered to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-zola">Zola’s</a> masterpiece. The book follows Étienne Lantier, a young man whose career as a railway worker is abruptly cut short after he attacks a superior. He arrives in Montsou, a coal mining town in the north of France, to begin a new life in a different industry. And the only industry around is mining coal.</p>
			<p>Étienne quickly befriends the locals as he embraces his new life in the mines, but the abject poverty of the miners shocks him, and he soon begins reading about socialism. When the owners of the mine conspire to lower the miners’ wages, Étienne seizes the opportunity and convinces the town to strike.</p>
			<p>Zola’s depiction of the mining town is shockingly bleak in its detail. He spent months researching the conditions of real-life miners, even going so far as pose as a government official so that he could descend into a mine personally. His encounter with a mining horse—brought underground as a foal to haul coal, never to see the light of day again—affected him so much that he wrote the animal into the plot. Montsou itself is a fully-realized town, with families and characters leading interconnected and nuanced lives across generations: lives so destitute, grueling, and filthy that Zola had to repeatedly defend his work against claims of hyperbole.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, the novel was a rallying cry for the workers of the world in an era when communist and socialist ideas were beginning to spread amongst the impoverished working class. The shabby but good-hearted inhabitants of Montsou, so blatantly oppressed by the bourgeois mine owners, are a blank slate for workers of any industry to identify with, and identify they did: <i>Germinal</i> inspired socialist causes for decades after its publication, with crowds chanting “Germinal!” at Zola’s funeral.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of blackmailers play a long game on several families.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-gaboriau">Gaboriau’s</a> penultimate <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/monsieur-lecoq">Lecoq</a> novel, Lecoq doesn’t make an appearance until the last few chapters of the book. In fact, the protagonists’ identity remains unclear until almost halfway through. They’re not missed, though, because the antagonists are a group of blackmailers of exhaustive ingenuity and knowledge, and piecing together the game they’re playing with several noblemen and women occupies all of one’s faculties for most of the book.</p>
			<p>Young love, old love, forbidden love, lost love, along with a couple of missing individuals: what is the blackmailers’ endgame? Will Lecoq be able to figure it out in time? Called “French sensational” in its day, Lecoq’s last case is still sensational today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A countess is murdered and suspects are quickly detained, but Lecoq is not satisfied and looks in a different direction to solve the case.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A murder is discovered. The authorities quickly arrest an obvious suspect. A detective spends hours at the scene in disguise before making himself known, and proceeds to minutely examine the evidence with the assistance of a doctor, among others, before proclaiming the answer lies in a completely different direction. One would be forgiven for thinking the detective must be a certain famous Englishman and his doctor companion.</p>
			<p>But this detective is French rather than English, a professional working for the police rather than an amateur, and indulges in candy lozenges rather than cocaine. If there is a straight line between <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe">Poe’s</a> Dupin and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Doyle’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Holmes</a>, then <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-gaboriau">Gaboriau’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/monsieur-lecoq">Lecoq</a> lies right in the middle of it. He is a master of disguise, he is proud and sometimes arrogant, he notices infinitesimal things others do not, he makes great leaps in deduction while others are struggling to take small steps. He is both strikingly similar and distinctly different than his more famous English “cousin.”</p>
			<p>Although Monsieur Lecoq appeared in Gaboriau’s first novel, there he played only a minor part. Here, he is the main attraction. Solving the murder of a countess and disappearance of a count requires all of Lecoq’s skills, and as he steadily unravels the mystery one sees the debt that is owed by all who came after him.</p>

		<summary type="text">A widow is found dead under mysterious circumstances, and Monsieur Lecoq of the police arranges to have his mentor brought in to help solve the crime.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Considered by many to be the first detective novel, <i>The Lerouge Case</i> (aka <i>The Widow Lerouge</i>) introduces <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/monsieur-lecoq">Monsieur Lecoq</a> (later Inspector Lecoq), a former “habitual criminal” who becomes a police officer. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-gaboriau">Émile Gaboriau</a> based Lecoq at least in part on an actual criminal-turned-police-officer, Eugène Vidocq, who went on to be the first director of the Sûreté. In this first book, Lecoq plays a relatively small part, the bulk of the mystery solving being done by Lecoq’s mentor Tabaret, an amateur detective.</p>
			<p>Gaboriau thus introduces both a police detective and an amateur detective at the same time. Many of the attributes now taken for granted in the mystery arena originated with Gaboriau and Lecoq—hyper attention to detail, mastery of disguises, amateur “agents” who assist the detective, and the above-mentioned amateur detectives that assist and sometimes out-perform the police versions.</p>
			<p>Gaboriau’s Lecoq novels were wildly successful until another amateur detective named <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Holmes</a> made his appearance. Holmes even comments on Lecoq in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/a-study-in-scarlet"><i>A Study in Scarlet</i></a>, dismissing him as a “miserable bungler” in response to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson’s question. Nevertheless, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> was obviously influenced by Gaboriau and Lecoq, as many of Holmes’ traits can be seen first in Lecoq.</p>

		<summary type="text">Monsieur Lecoq’s first case in which he tries to determine the identity of a man in custody for three murders.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The last <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/monsieur-lecoq">Lecoq</a> novel goes back to the beginning, to Monsieur Lecoq’s first case, the case that began his reputation as a master of detection, master of disguise, and master of detail. The case begins simply: Lecoq and several other policemen come upon a crime as it’s being committed. Three men are dead and the killer is in custody. But who is he? Lecoq and his companion officer spend months trying to figure it out, to no avail. Lecoq finally goes to visit his old mentor in order to gain some insight.</p>
			<p>The scene then changes to some fifty years previous; in the aftermath of Waterloo, some noblemen return from exile. One of them insults the character of a local who has acted honorably on the nobleman’s behalf, and the remainder of the novel is devoted to how those few minutes end up unravelling the lives of everyone present, and many who aren’t.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-gaboriau">Gaboriau</a> again demonstrates his ability to mix detective mystery and Dickensian drama, and foreshadows the style of the first two novels of his more famous English cousin in detection.</p>

		<summary type="text">A bank is robbed and only two men appear to have the means to have done it; Monsieur Lecoq must discern if it was one of them or an “impossible” third party.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A bank safe is robbed. Only two men have both the key and the combination to the safe. The police naturally look to the employee rather than the owner of the bank. But <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/monsieur-lecoq">Monsieur Lecoq</a>, as always, sees what everyone else misses. Was it one of the two? Or was it a seemingly-impossible third party? Only Lecoq will be able to determine it. But why doesn’t he want his involvement in the case known?</p>
			<p>Like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-gaboriau">Gaboriau’s</a> two novels before it, <i>File <abbr>No.</abbr> 113</i> is a mystery with a Dickensian tragedy behind it. Men and women of good character, of bad character, and good character who make bad choices abound, and remind us that the best mysteries have great personalities inhabiting them.</p>

		<summary type="text">A romance begins over the wire between two telegraph operators.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ella-cheever-thayer">Ella Cheever Thayer</a> used her experience of being a telegraph operator at the Brunswick Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, to write <i>Wired Love: A Romance of Dots and Dashes</i>. The story begins when Nathalie Rogers receives a call from another telegrapher, “C,” who manages to make her laugh. Little did they know, this was the beginning of an unusual romance (for the time period) between two people who don’t know anything about each other—not even what they look like. <i>Wired Love</i> was a bestseller for 10 years after it was published.</p>

		<summary type="text">A series of sketches about small town life in a changing mid-Victorian England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Cranford</i> was first serialized in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens’</a> magazine <i>Household Words</i> between 1851 and 1853. The structureless nature of the stories, and the fact that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/elizabeth-gaskell">Gaskell</a> was busy writing her novel <i>Ruth</i> at the time the <i>Cranford</i> shorts were being published, suggests that she didn’t initially plan for <i>Cranford</i> to be a cohesive novel.</p>
			<p>The short vignettes follow the activities of the society in the fictional small English country town of Cranford. Gaskell drew from her own childhood in Knutsford to imbue her settings and characters with a nostalgic quality in a time when the societies and styles portrayed were already going out of fashion.</p>
			<p>Though not especially popular at the time of publication, <i>Cranford</i> has since gained an immense following, including at least three television adaptations.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of 44 love sonnets.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> is a collection of forty-four love sonnets. Despite what the title suggests, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/elizabeth-barrett-browning">Browning</a> in fact composed the sonnets in English. She decided to frame them as “translations” because she was concerned they may have been too personal to publish. Fortunately her husband, Robert Browning, convinced her to publish them, and they went on to become some of the most famous and critically-acclaimed love sonnets to this day.</p>

		<summary type="text">The Finnish national epic poem recounting the creation of the Earth and the adventures of its mythical heroes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Kalevala</i> is a Finnish epic poem, which tells of the creation of the world and how the heroes that inhabit it came to be, and the legends of their conflicts and adventures. Spread out over fifty cantos, we hear how existence was created from the egg of a duck, how the forests were created from the chips of a world-tree felled by an ancient wizard, how the mighty Sampo—a multicolored mill of plenty—was created and later stolen, how the nine dread diseases came to be, and many more such stories.</p>
			<p>The tales contained here are formed from Finland’s oral history. The author, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/elias-lonnrot">Elias Lönnrot</a>, was a Finnish doctor who was fascinated with his country’s stories, so between the 1820s and 1850s he embarked on a series of expeditions to the countryside of Finland and the surrounding area to collect and transcribe the folk stories told by local people. These tales were gradually collected into several volumes, the final of which is this “new” <i>Kalevala</i>. Lönnrot collected many different variants of each story, then edited each down into a cohesive whole when composing the new verse. The distinctive Kalevala-meter that was a common feature of all the original oral stories was kept during the process, and Crawford used the same with this English translation.</p>
			<p>Lönnrot’s work proved extremely influential in Finland, and the national pride it imbued has been cited as a factor in the later Finnish independence movement. The <i>Kalevala</i> was also a source of inspiration for later authors of the twentieth century. Tolkien reused some of the themes and characters for the basis of his fictional universe (in particular <i>The Silmarillion</i>), the Kalevala-meter was used in Longfellow’s <i>The Song of Hiawatha</i>, and even Donald Duck has quested—as the Kalevala heroes did—for the legendary Sampo.</p>
			<p>This edition was translated by John Martin Crawford in the late nineteenth century, and includes his introduction discussing some of the themes, characters, and settings.</p>

		<summary type="text">A square is pulled out of his reality by a sphere, and shown the meaning of three dimensions.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Flatland</i> is uniquely both a social critique and a primer on multi-dimensional geometry. Written in two parts in 1884 by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edwin-a-abbott">Edwin <abbr>A.</abbr> Abbott</a>, an English mathematician and theologian, it tells the story of a square living in Flatland: a two-dimensional realm. After a dream of a restrictive one-dimensional existence and the difficulties this poses, he is visited by a sphere from a three-dimensional space who wishes to enlighten him into the ways of “Upward, yet not Northward.”</p>
			<p>Edwin <abbr>A.</abbr> Abbott wrote other theological fiction and non-fiction (including several biographies), but he is best remembered for <i>Flatland</i>. While it was mostly forgotten after publication, it received a revived interest from the 1960s onwards, and has more recently had several sequels and film adaptations. This edition of is based on the second published edition and includes its preface, which in part attempts to address some of the contemporary accusations of misogyny.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of literary nonsense in the forms of limericks, songs, and short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edward-lear">Edward Lear</a> began his career as an ornithological illustrator, becoming one of the first major artists to draw birds from living models. During this period he was employed to paint the birds from the private menagerie owned by Edward Stanley, the 13th Earl of Derby and one of Lear’s closest friends. In 1837, Lear’s health started to decline. His deteriorating eyesight and failing lungs forced him to abandon the detailed painting required for depicting birds, and, with the help of the earl, he moved to Rome where he established himself as a poet of literary nonsense.</p>
			<p>While Lear was visiting the Earl of Derby, he wrote poems and drew silly sketches to entertain the earl’s children. In 1846, he collected together his pile of limericks and illustrations and published his first poetical book, titled <i>A Book of Nonsense</i> and dedicated to the Earl of Derby and his children. He decided to publish under the pseudonym Derry down Derry, but after he started making plans for more books, he republished under his real name.</p>
			<p>His next book, <i>Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany, and Alphabets</i> wasn’t published until 24 years later, in 1870. Lear then released <i>More Nonsense</i>, which contains more limericks, in 1872, and <i>Laughable Lyrics</i> in 1877. This final book in the series contains many of Lear’s most famous fantastical creatures, such as the Quangle Wangle. The influence of Lear’s poetry in the twentieth-century can be seen in styles like the surrealism movement and the theater of the absurd.</p>

		<summary type="text">A woman discovers her own inner strength when she decides to teach children in a rural farming area.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Selina Peake moves from Chicago to a rural Dutch farming area just outside the city to teach in a one room school. As she attempts to fit into the community, she learns about her own strength in adapting to rural life. She marries an uneducated but sweet Dutch farmer named Pervus DeJong and has a son, Dirk, nicknamed “So Big.” She wishes her son to have the same appreciation for the arts and education she has, and although he becomes an architect, his disillusionment with the architectural apprentice system leads him to a career as a successful bond salesman. He later regrets eschewing his architecture career when he meets a beautiful and eccentric artist.</p>

		<summary type="text">A New York socialite struggles to maintain a place among her wealthy friends in the face of her own diminished finances and fading youth.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The House of Mirth</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton">Edith Wharton’s</a> biting critique of New York’s upper classes around the end of the 19th century. The novel follows socialite Lily Bart as she struggles to maintain a precarious position among her wealthy friends in the face of her own diminished finances and fading youth. Lily has resolved to gain social and financial security by marrying into wealth, but callous rivals and her own second thoughts undermine Lily’s plans.</p>
			<p>Wharton’s insights into high society were largely built on her own experiences growing up among the upper crust, and her confident portrayal of a morally lax aristocracy found an eager audience. The novel sold over a hundred thousand copies within a few months of its release and became her first great success as a published author.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman has resigned to life in a stifling small town until a visiting stranger hints at a wider world of possibilities.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton">Edith Wharton’s</a> controversial novel <i>Summer</i> is the story of Charity Royall, an ambitious young woman trapped in a stifling small town by both her gender and her social class. When a visiting stranger arrives in town, Charity is awakened to a wider world of possibilities and to the realities that constrain her.</p>
			<p>Published in 1917, the novel was both attacked and ignored for openly acknowledging female sexuality and its many inequities. Later generations of critics have come to regard the book as an important turning point in Wharton’s work and a spiritual companion to her classic novel, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton/ethan-frome"><i>Ethan Frome</i></a>.</p>

			<p>Ethan Frome is a young man whose nascent ambitions were thwarted by illness and privation.

		<summary type="text">When the beautiful Princess Thuvia of Ptarth is kidnapped, suspicion falls on John Carter’s son Carthoris, who sets out to rescue the woman he loves.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Thuvia, Maid of Mars</i> moves the focus of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Burroughs’</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/martian">Martian series</a> to Carthoris, the son of the human John Carter and Martian Dejah Thoris and the prince of Helium.</p>
			<p>Princess Thuvia of Ptarth and Prince Carthoris of Helium are in love. Fate, however, is against them: the princess is promised to another, the Jeddak of Kaol, Kulan Tith. So when the princess is kidnapped, suspicion falls on Carthoris, who sets out as his father would have to rescue the damsel and clear his name. As the great airborn navies of Mars’ military powers charge inexorably towards a needless war, Carthoris pursues the imperiled princess across borders and battlefields, making new enemies and allies along the way on a journey which traverses far and forgotten corners of Barsoom.</p>
			<p><i>Thuvia, Maid of Mars</i> presents many familiar themes from Burroughs’ books, such as damsels in distress, fantastical adventures, chivalry, and derring-do, set against a backdrop of looming war and political intrigue. But it also introduces new elements, such as psychic armies and new flight technologies, as well as bringing entirely new races and settings to the series. It was originally published in 1916 as three serialized parts in <i>All-Story Weekly</i>, and published as a novel in 1920.</p>

		<summary type="text">Upon discovering his father’s past life in the jungles of Africa, Tarzan’s son sets out to follow in his footsteps.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Following the events in <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs/the-beasts-of-tarzan">The Beasts of Tarzan</a></i>, Tarzan and his wife, Jane, return to England to raise their infant son, Jack. Now, ten years later, Jane has refused to allow Tarzan to share his past in the jungles with their son for fear of awakening a desire in him to follow in his father’s footsteps. Unfortunately, Jack is already feeling drawn to Africa, and when one of Tarzan’s old friends surfaces, Jack is quick to set out on his own adventure.</p>
			<p><i>The Son of Tarzan</i> was originally published as a serial in <i>All-Story Weekly</i> between December 4, 1915 and January 8, 1916. It’s the fourth book in the Tarzan series, and is only entry without Tarzan as the main character. Since its initial publication, the book has been adapted to both film and comics.</p>

		<summary type="text">Stranded U-boat survivors and their rescuers contend with dangerous beasts and prehistoric people in a strange lost world.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Land That Time Forgot</i> opens with the discovery near Greenland of a floating thermos flask containing a manuscript by castaway Tyler Bowen, Jr. The document recounts a series of adventures that starts with a sea battle against a German U-boat and ends on a mysterious island populated by hostile prehistoric animals and people.</p>
			<p>The second part of the book, “The People That Time Forgot,” continues the story with the tale of Tom Billings, who has been sent on a mission to rescue Bowen after his manuscript was discovered. He flies solo over the mountainous cliffs that encircle the island and is attacked by a monstrous flying reptile, forcing him to crash-land. Billings then attempts to make his way on foot back to the rest of his party while contending with dangerous inhabitants from different stages of human development.</p>
			<p>The final installment of the story, “Out of Time’s Abyss,” reveals what happened to Bradley, a crew member who was sent on a scouting expedition earlier in the story and was never heard from again.</p>
			<p>This trilogy of short novels was originally published serially in 1918 in <i>Blue Book Magazine</i>. In 1924 they were published in a single volume by A. C. McClurg. The <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Burroughs</a> fan community seems to fall into two camps about whether the story comprises three separate novellas, or whether it’s a single novel divided into three parts. This Standard Ebooks edition follows the 1924 edition in combining the three into a single novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">John Carter returns to Mars to try and determine the fate of his lost love Dejah Thoris.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Gods of Mars</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Burroughs’</a> sequel to <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs/a-princess-of-mars">A Princess of Mars</a></i>. After ten long years, John Carter is again transported to Mars to try and determine the fate of his wife Dejah Thoris, but finds himself in the forbidden Valley Dor, from which no man may return. Published serially in five parts between January and May 1913, this sequel appeared a year after the initial serialization of its predecessor. It was eventually published in its full novel form in 1918.</p>
			<p>Although the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/martian">Martian series</a> contains ten books in total, the first three—of which <i>The Gods of Mars</i> is the second—are often considered a stand-alone trilogy. Throughout the series, Burroughs’ imagination and sense of adventure shine through, and his extravagant prose and innovative vocabulary raise the works up above run-of-the-mill pulp fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">Tara, Princess of Helium and daughter of John Carter, finds life-threatening adventure in thrilling far-off regions of Barsoom.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Chessmen of Mars</i>, the fifth installment in the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/martian">Martian series</a>, was originally serialized in six parts in <i>Argosy All-Story Weekly</i> before being published as a novel in 1922. It introduces Tara, Princess of Helium, the headstrong daughter of John Carter, the Warlord of Mars. Just like the rest of the novels in the series, this one is packed with imaginative characters and locations. In true Barsoomian fashion, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Burroughs</a> regales us with an action-packed adventure: planet-shaking storms, daring swordfights, horrific dungeons, complex alien cultures, and wild escapes. While the story may be considered a standard pulp adventure, it also introduces a bit of philosophy by exploring the connection between the mind and the body.</p>
			<p>Of special note is Jetan, or Martian chess, which holds a central place in the storyline. Burroughs includes an appendix so that interested readers may play the game themselves.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphan is raised by apes in Africa and goes on various adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The baby of an English aristocratic family becomes orphaned in the equatorial African jungle, and is raised by apes. As he grows up he discovers he is human, and very different from his anthropoid companions. He learns and develops human traits, yet retains his primitive skills and physical prowess. As he comes into contact with other humans, conflict, adventure, wonder, and triumph result. To those he encounters, Tarzan becomes a symbol of the natural man, contrasting with the shortcomings and perfidies of human society.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two explorers burrow deep into the planet’s crust and emerge in a savage land inside a hollow Earth, where they have many adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>At the Earth’s Core</i>, published in 1914, is the first of a series of science fiction novels written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> set inside a hollow earth with a central “sun,” a land called Pellucidar. However unlikely this scenario, it allowed Burroughs free play to create heroic adventures in yet another alien environment in addition to his fantastic version of Mars in his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/martian">Martian series</a>.</p>
			<p>The story’s hero, David Innes, is recruited by an old man, Perry, to help fund his invention, a “mechanical subterranean prospector,” and then to test it out. Unfortunately once the powerful burrowing machine is set going, it cannot be steered, and the pair find themselves burrowing deeper and deeper into the Earth’s crust. To their astonishment, rather than dying from suffocation or increasing heat, they emerge inside a hollow shell inside the Earth. This world is populated by prehistoric creatures as well as primitive humans, intelligent gorillas, and supremely intelligent pterosaurs, the masters of this land. David and Perry are captured by these creatures and many adventures ensue.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adventurer finds himself battling alien civilizations on the strange surface of Mars.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, John Carter is transported to a Mars inhabited by strange civilizations and embarks on various adventures on his quest home. Often held up as a seminal example of pulp science fiction, <i>A Princess of Mars</i> is the first entry in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Burroughs’</a> epic <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/martian">Martian series</a>, and the first to feature the character of John Carter.</p>
			<p>Though often categorized as just a pulp adventure tale, <i>A Princess of Mars</i> was hugely influential on many budding science fiction writers, professional scientists, and explorers of the day. The novel remains a light, fast-paced, and enjoyable read, and continues to inspire adaptations nearly a hundred years after its publication.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young stowaway embarks on high-seas adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> is famed for his unsettling <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe/short-fiction">short stories</a>, but he also wrote a full-length novel, his only one: <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i>. Framed as the recollections of an adventurous stowaway, <i>Pym</i> begins as a swashbuckling adventure novel, and after growing increasingly weirder, ends on a surreal note worthy of the best of Poe’s short stories.</p>
			<p>Despite Poe himself calling it a “a very silly book,” <i>Pym</i> went on to become one of his most-translated and influential works, coloring the themes of future adventure and weird fiction writers like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne">Jules Verne</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H.

		<summary type="text">A collection of Edgar Allan Poe’s short fiction, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> is one of the primary figures of American nineteenth-century literature. His writing was heavily influenced by Romanticism ideals of emotion and feeling, and although mostly known for his Gothic-tinged horror, his tales jump between many different genres, including science-fiction, satire, humor, mystery, and even early detective fiction.</p>
			<p>Poe mostly wrote short stories and poems, published in magazines and periodicals like the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> and <i>Graham’s Magazine</i>, although he also turned his hand to essays and novels (including <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe/the-narrative-of-arthur-gordon-pym-of-nantucket"><i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i></a>). He was one of the first American writers to pursue writing as a career, but was better received in France than in his native country. He struggled to make ends meet and resorted to work as a literary critic. His reputation suffered a further blow after his unfortunately early death in 1849 at the age of 40, when a rival not only wrote an extremely unflattering obituary, but bought the rights to his work and published a compilation with a hit piece for an introduction. This undeserved reputation took many decades to fade, but didn’t hinder praise from other notable authors including <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a>.</p>
			<p>Collected here are all of Poe’s short fiction stories, in order of their original magazine publication. Notable stories include “The Gold-Bug,” “The Black Cat,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Pit and the Pendulum,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” and many more.</p>

			<p>After the events of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-w-hornung/the-amateur-cracksman"><i>The Amateur Cracksman</i></a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/a-j-raffles"><abbr>A.

			<p>Raffles was a commercial success for <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-w-hornung"><abbr>E.

		<summary type="text">A British cricketer and his friend steal valuables in this first collection of A. J. Raffles short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/a-j-raffles"><abbr>A. J.</abbr> Raffles</a> and his friend “Bunny” Manders are the quintessential rich young socialites; but behind the high-living façade, they’ve exhausted their funds. There’s only one way to pay the bills: a secret double-life as criminals.</p>
			<p>Raffles was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-w-hornung"><abbr>E. W.</abbr> Hornung’s</a> biggest literary success, with the Raffles stories proving perennially popular. This volume was dedicated to his brother-in-law <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, and in Raffles and Manders there is a clear relation to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Holmes</a> and Watson. The character’s popularity helped kickstart the “gentleman thief” genre, and it’s easy to see parallels to the later stories of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Maurice Leblanc</a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A gentleman bachelor gains an epic advantage of tiny proportions in this allegorical, Romantic, fairy-tale novel.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-t-a-hoffmann">Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann</a> was a contemporary of Ludwig von Beethoven: a composer himself, a music critic, and a late-German-Romantic-movement writer of novels and numerous short stories. His incisive wit and poetic imagery allow the reader to peer into the foibles of society and the follies of human psychology. (In fact, Hoffmann’s wit may have gotten him into a bit of legal trouble, as parts of <i>Master Flea</i> were censored and had to be reworked when authorities disliked certain satirical criticisms of contemporary dealings of the court system.)</p>
			<p>Join gentleman bachelor Peregrine Tyss as his life as a recluse takes a twist, when he gains an epic advantage of tiny proportions. Part proto-science-fiction and part Romantic fantasy, <i>Master Flea</i> follows the fate of a mysterious, captivating princess at the intersection of numerous suitors, human and insect. Like a lesson from a fable or a tale of classical mythology, Hoffmann’s fairy-tale allegory shows how seeking forbidden knowledge can poison the soul, and how following the heart can heal it.</p>

		<summary type="text">The King Gorice of Witchland and the lords of Demonland wage war in the high-fantasy lands of Mercury.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Worm Ouroboros</i> is considered to be one of the foundational texts of the high fantasy genre, influencing later authors like J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Ursula K. Leguin, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-branch-cabell">James Branch Cabell</a>. It is most frequently compared to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in its epic scope set against a medieval, magic-laced backdrop—a world called “Middle Earth” by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-r-eddison">Eddison</a>, thirty-two years before Tolkien’s—and in its almost mythical portrayal of larger-than-life heroes and villains.</p>
			<p>The plot begins simply enough: The Lords of Demonland, a group of heroic warriors enjoying a strained peace, are called upon by an emissary of the warlock king of Witchland, Gorice XI. The emissary demands that Demonland submit to the King of Witchland—but the proud Demons refuse, setting off an epic war that spans their entire world. The heroic struggles of the Demons and their allies against the Witches reflect the circular nature of human history: the snake eating its own tail of the title.</p>
			<p>The novel is written in a purposefully archaic, almost Jacobean style. The rich, surprising vocabulary and unusual spelling are testaments to Eddison’s expertise at reading and translating medieval-era texts. To this day, it remains perhaps unique in fantasy literature in the accuracy and precision of its highly affected prose style, perhaps matched only by the out-of-time strangeness of the prose in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-hope-hodgson">Hodgson’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-hope-hodgson/the-night-land">The Night Land</a></i>. But where critics often find <i>The Night Land</i>’s prose obtuse and difficult, they have nothing but praise for Eddison’s beautiful, quotable style.</p>
			<p>Eddison had already imagined the story and its heroes as a child, and drawings he made as a youth of events in the book are preserved in the Bodleian library. While the novel is without a doubt the work of a mature and skilled writer, and while some of the events and characters are portrayed differently in the novel than they were in his youthful sketches, the names of many of the characters and places remain unchanged. Some of his contemporaries, like Tolkien, wondered about the strange naming style; others criticized it as taking away from the more serious subject matter.</p>
			<p><i>The Worm Ouroboros</i> remains one of the most influential works in the high fantasy genre to this day, and traces of the foundation it laid can be still be found in genre books a century after its publication.</p>

			<p>It’s 1913, and war is on the horizon. The disgraced English aristocrat, Everard Dominey, is stumbling through East Africa when he comes across his old classmate and lookalike—the German Baron von Ragastein.

			<p>As Dominey attempts to resume his life, he must reacquaint himself with his insane and murderous wife, the passionate ex-lover that recognizes him, and uncover the mystery of the death that led to his exile.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-phillips-oppenheim">Oppenheim’s</a> classic spy-thriller was enormously popular when it was first published in 1920, selling over a million copies, and leading to three major motion pictures.

		<summary type="text">E. Pauline Johnson’s collection of legends and myths of the Squamish people.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-pauline-johnson">Emily Pauline Johnson</a>, who was also known by the Mohawk name Tekahionwake, was a Canadian poet and author born in 1861. Born to a Mohawk father and an English mother, she was known for introducing indigenous culture to a wider North American and European audience.</p>
			<p>In <i>Legends of Vancouver</i>, perhaps her best-known prose work, Johnson tells stories of the Squamish people, as relayed to her by Chief Joe Capilano, whom she befriended upon moving to Vancouver in 1909. She provides her own framing for these stories, placing them in the context of her relationship with the Squamish people.</p>
			<p>In 1911, a group of Johnson’s friends collected this series of stories, that had previously been published in the <i>Daily Province</i>, in order to raise funds to support her as she struggled with poverty and health issues. In the intervening years, <i>Legends of Vancouver</i> has become a foundational piece of Vancouver’s literary heritage.</p>

		<summary type="text">After an English widow on holiday impetuously falls in love with a handsome young Tuscan, her panicked in-laws send a rescue party.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Soon after the widowed Lilia Herriton arrives at the dusty Tuscan town of Monteriano with her friend Caroline Abbott, she falls in love with Gino Carella, a handsome—and younger—man. When her overbearing in-laws hear of the engagement, they panic, believing a marriage like that would dishonor their family and the memory of Lilia’s late husband and their child.</p>
			<p>Lilia’s brother-in-law, Philip Herriton, rushes to Italy to stop the marriage and “rescue” Lilia from Gino. He soon discovers that he’s too late, and that they’ve already married. Their impulsive decision will have major consequences—not just for the couple itself, but also for Caroline, Philip, and everyone else in their orbit.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-m-forster">Forster</a> was just twenty-six in 1905 when <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i>, his first novel, was published. In a contemporary review, <i>The Manchester Guardian</i> called it “almost startlingly original” in its setting and the treatment of its motive, but also wondered if Forster could “could be a little more charitable” in future works. In 1991 it was made into a movie starring Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham Carter, Judy Davis, and Rubert Graves.</p>

		<summary type="text">The lives of three families of different classes intertwine in Edwardian England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Howards End</i>, published in 1910, is considered by many to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-m-forster">Forster’s</a> masterpiece. The plot revolves around three families in Edwardian England: the Schlegels, a trio of half-German, middle-class siblings who to poor people seem rich, but to rich people seem poor; the Wilcoxes, a large, wealthy family of businessmen; and the Basts, a lower class young couple struggling to keep up appearances.</p>
			<p>The Schlegel siblings are sharp, intelligent, and idealistic, and they pursue culture and art with an enthusiasm reminiscent of the Bloomsbury group. They befriend the Wilcoxes while on a trip abroad, and the lonely Wilcox matriarch and Margaret Schlegel, the strong-willed elder sister, strike up a friendship. As their families begin butting heads in London, Helen, the younger Schlegel sister, runs in to Leonard Bast while at the opera. Bast is proud and ambitious, but clearly impoverished and lacking gentility. Helen, a rash and fiery idealist, takes him up as a pet project, oblivious to the deep cultural gulf between Bast and themselves as she tries her best to educate him in matters of art and literature and lift him out of his class.</p>
			<p>The interplay between the three families becomes a complex reflection on social codes and class difference in England: how class can lock lives in place, and how even the well-to-do are not immune from becoming ossified in their station thanks to the seemingly-unbreakable social conventions of the age. Capitalism, a still-new philosophy of life, is juxtaposed against humanism and the arts as the families try to do what they each think is the right thing. Forster weaves these threads expertly against the backdrop of London city life and the cozy family cottage of Howards End, the ultimate centerpiece in these three families’ lives.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young English woman falls in love while on tour in Italy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Room With a View</i>, perhaps <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-m-forster"><abbr>E. M.</abbr> Forster’s</a> lightest novel, was also one long in gestation—he began it as early as 1901, and only published it in 1908.</p>
			<p>In it we meet young Lucy Honeychurch and her cousin Charlotte Bartlett, who have gone on tour to Italy. During their stay they meet a series of interesting characters, including George Emerson, the son of an eccentric gentleman. The conflict between Lucy’s choice of the unusual George, or her more conventional English suitor Cecil, forms the crux of Forster’s critique of contemporary English society.</p>
			<p>Despite the novel being a societal critique, the prose is light and studded with Forster’s easy witticisms. In 1958 Forster added an appendix elaborating on what occurred to the main characters after the novel’s end: the two world wars figure largely in their futures.</p>

		<summary type="text">A suspected assault brings racial tensions to a boil in British Raj India.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The setting of <i>A Passage to India</i> is the British Raj, at a time of racial tension heightened by the burgeoning Indian independence movement. Adela Quested, a young British subject, is visiting India to decide whether to marry a suitor who works there as a city magistrate. During her visit, a local physician, Aziz, is accused of assaulting her. His trial brings tensions between the British rulers and their Indian subjects to a head.</p>
			<p>The novel is a complex exploration of colonialism, written at a time when the popular portrayal of the Indian continent was of mystery and savagery. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-m-forster">Forster</a> humanized the Indian people for his at-home British audience, highlighting the damage that colonialism caused not just to interpersonal relationships, but to society at large. On the other hand, some modern scholars view the failure of the human relationships in the book as suggesting a fundamental “otherness” between the two cultures: a gulf across which the disparate cultures can only see each other’s shadows. In any case, the novel generated—and continues to generate—an abundant amount of critical analysis.</p>
			<p><i>A Passage to India</i> is the last novel Forster published in his lifetime, and it frequently appears in “best-of” lists of literature: The Modern Library selected it as one of its <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/modern-librarys-100-best-novels">100 great works of the 20th century</a>, <i>Time</i> magazine included it in its “All Time 100 Novels” list, and it won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">In a universe where all powerful alien races influence the fates of worlds, a war erupts between the Triplanetary League of the inner solar system, pirates led by a mysterious and malicious scientist, and technologically advanced aliens.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Hundreds of millions of years ago, two near-omnipotent alien races encountered each other, beginning a conflict that will shape the history of the entire universe. The benevolent Arisians covertly influence humanity, hoping to create a people capable of one day defeating the vile Eddorians, who are waging their own campaign for the fate of civilization on Earth. This sets the stage for a clash between the Triplanetary League of the inner solar system, the enigmatic pirate-scientist Roger, and the Nevians, interlopers whose first appearance wreaks havoc among the other parties.</p>
			<p><i>Triplanetary</i> is the first of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-e-smith">Edward E. “Doc” Smith’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/lensman">Lensman</a> series, an early and influential entry in the space opera genre. Originally serialized in <i>Amazing Stories</i> in 1934 as a stand-alone story, <i>Triplanetary</i> was collected in book form in 1948 with six new chapters and numerous additions, changing the story to be a prequel to the rest of the Lensman series.</p>

			<p><i>The Skylark of Space</i> is said to be the seminal space opera. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Seaton accidentally discovers a source of energy which could be used to travel to other star systems, but when he tries to show others, it fails to work. Most of his colleagues ridicule him, and he quits his career to focus on trying to refine the process. Meanwhile <abbr>Dr.</abbr> DuQuesne realizes the truth, and is willing to do anything to have that power.</p>
			<p>Both scientists refine the process well enough to build a spaceship and visit other planets, but who will these new civilizations side with?</p>
			<p>This version of <i>The Skylark of Space</i> was originally published in three parts during 1928 <i>Amazing Stories</i>. The novelization, which was published later, differs significantly.</p>

		<summary type="text">Virgil Samms, the first individual to receive a Lens from the mysterious and powerful Arisians, works to create the Galatic Patrol to protect all adherents of Civilization from the threat of the Boskonians and their masters, the Eddorians.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Against the backdrop of a secret war between two all-powerful alien races, Virgil Samms of the Triplanetary Service is selected by the seemingly omniscient Arisians to be the first bearer of the Lens. Only individuals deemed brave, virtuous, capable, and incorruptible can receive a Lens, which grants its user telepathy and other powers. With it, Samms seeks out other “Lens worthy” humans and aliens, with the goal of creating a Galactic Patrol that will defend planets adhering to Civilization from corruption, vice, and piracy.</p>
			<p><i>First Lensman</i> is the second book in <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-e-smith">E. E. Smith’s</a></i> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/lensman">Lensman</a> series but was the last to be written. Unlike the rest of the series, it was never serialized, and was first published in 1950 to help link <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-e-smith/triplanetary">Triplanetary</a></i> with <i>Galactic Patrol</i>. Smith’s imaginative and bizarre alien races are on full display, as well as the constantly escalating space warfare that is the hallmark of the space opera genre.</p>

		<summary type="text">E. E. Cummings describes the experiences of his and his fellow inmates’ imprisonment during World War I.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In Great War–era France, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-e-cummings"><abbr>E. E.</abbr> Cummings</a> is lifted, along with his friend <abbr>B.</abbr>, from his job as an ambulance driver with the Red Cross, and deposited in a jail in La Ferté Macé as a suspected spy. There his life consists of strolls in the <i lang="fr">cour</i>, <i lang="fr">la soupe</i>, and his mattress in The Enormous Room, the male prisoners’ communal cell. It’s these prisoners whom Cummings describes in lurid detail.</p>
			<p><i>The Enormous Room</i> is far from a straightforward autobiographical diary. Cummings’ descriptions, peppered liberally with colloquial French, avoid time and, for the most part, place, and instead focus on the personal aspects of his internment, especially in the almost metaphysical description of the most otherworldly of his compatriots: The Delectable Mountains.</p>
			<p>During his imprisonment, Cummings’ father petitioned the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and French authorities for his liberty. This, and his eventual return home, are described in the book’s introduction.</p>

		<summary type="text">An aristocratic detective unravels the mystery of a body deposited in a bathtub in 1920s England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Whose Body?</i>, published in 1923, is the first in a long and very popular series of mystery novels written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dorothy-l-sayers">Dorothy <abbr>L.</abbr> Sayers</a> and featuring her aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey.</p>
			<p>In this novel we are introduced to Wimsey, his imperturbable and multi-skilled butler Bunter, and his close friend Charles Parker of Scotland Yard as they come together to investigate an extremely mysterious incident: the naked body of a man, wearing a golden pince-nez, has been discovered in the bath of a bewildered tenant of a flat in Battersea. There’s a good deal of humor in the book, carefully balanced against the grim reality of murder.</p>
			<p><i>Whose Body?</i> was well-received on first publication, and provided a basis for Sayer’s successful career as a novelist. In sum, she wrote some eleven Wimsey novels as well as several short stories featuring the characters. Nevertheless, it appears that she herself felt that her translation of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dante-alighieri">Dante’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dante-alighieri/the-divine-comedy/henry-wadsworth-longfellow"><i>Divine Comedy</i></a> was her greatest literary work.</p>

			<p>Though <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dorothy-day">Dorothy Day</a> may be best known today for her religious peace activism and her role in founding the Catholic Worker movement, she lived a bohemian youth in the Lower West Side of New York City during the late 1910s and early 1920s. As an editor for radical socialist publications like <i>The Liberator</i> and <i>The Masses</i>, Day was involved in several left-wing causes as well as the Silent Sentinels’ 1917 protest for women’s suffrage in front of the White House.</p>
			<p><i>The Eleventh Virgin</i> is a semi-autobiographical novel told through the eyes of June Henreddy, a young radical journalist whose fictional life closely parallels Day’s own life experiences, including her eventual disillusionment with her bohemian lifestyle. Though later derided by Day as “a very bad book,” <i>The Eleventh Virgin</i> captures a vibrant image of New York’s radical counterculture in the early 20th century and sheds a light on the youthful misadventures of a woman who would eventually be praised by Pope Francis for her dream of “social justice and the rights of persons” during his historic address to a joint session of Congress in 2015.</p>

		<summary type="text">Brief biographies of the prominent philosophers of ancient Greece.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>These brief biographies of more than eighty philosophers of ancient Greece were assembled by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/diogenes-laertius">Diogenes Laërtius</a> in the early third century. He based these on a variety of sources that have since been lost. Because of this, his biographies have become an invaluable source of information on the development of ancient Greek philosophy, and on ancient Greek culture in general. Most of what we know about the lives and otherwise lost doctrines of Zeno the Stoic and Diogenes the Cynic, for example, come from what Diogenes Laërtius preserved in this book. Mourning what else we have lost, Montaigne wrote: “I am very sorry we have not a dozen Laërtii.”</p>
			<p>Steamy romance, barbed humor, wicked cattiness, tender acts of humanity, jealous feuds, terrible puns, sophistical paradoxes, deathbed deceptions, forgery, and political intrigue … while the philosophers of ancient Greece were developing their remarkable and penetrating philosophies, they were also leading strange and varied lives—at times living out their principles in practice, at other times seeming to defy all principle.</p>
			<p>Diogenes Laërtius collected as much biographical information as he could find about these ancient sages, and tried to sift through the sometimes contradictory accounts to find the true story. He shares with us anecdotes and witty remarks and biographical details that reveal the people behind the philosophies, and frequently adds a brief poem of his own construction that comments sardonically on how each philosopher died.</p>

		<summary type="text">One man’s journey through a psychedelic alien landscape of philosophy, religion, life, and death.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>On hearing the title <i>A Voyage to Arcturus</i>, one might picture an astronaut strapping themselves into a rocket and flying into space for a swashbuckling adventure. Nothing could be further from what this book actually is.</p>
			<p><i>Voyage</i> is in fact a fascinating, bizarre, bewildering, and thought-provoking sort of acid-fueled <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-bunyan/the-pilgrims-progress"><i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i></a>: a philosophical allegory told through the frame of a psychedelic gender-bending journey to an alien planet.</p>
			<p>After a terrifying séance, the protagonist, Maskull, is offered the chance of an adventure on a different world. He agrees, and the reader follows him on his blood-soaked path through lands representing different philosophies and ways of life as he searches for the world’s godhead, Surtur. Or is it Crystalman?</p>
			<p><i>Voyage</i> features fiction wildly ahead of its time, and is hardly classifiable as either science fiction or fantasy; one might even say that the book is better approached as a philosophical work than a straightforward narrative. It’s not a book for a reader seeking simple fiction, but rather for a reader seeking a thoughtful, imaginative, and totally unexpected exploration of philosophy and of life.</p>
			<p>Decades ahead of its time, <i>Voyage</i> was praised by contemporaries like <abbr>C. S.</abbr> Lewis and <abbr>J. R. R.</abbr> Tolkien, and by modern authors like Clive Barker and Alan Moore. Many modern reviewers consider it a masterpiece of 20th century fiction and the work of an underappreciated genius. A century later it boasts a significant cult following, having inspired movies, plays, albums, and even operas, as well as a modern sequel by famous literary critic Harold Bloom—the only work of fiction he ever wrote.</p>

		<summary type="text">A newly-married young woman is suddenly transformed into a fox, to the consternation and enduring grief of her husband.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A newly-married couple are taking a leisurely walk through the woods in England when, without warning, the woman suddenly transforms into a fox. The grief-stricken husband does his best to look after his transformed wife after this astonishing change.</p>
			<p>That’s the unlikely premise of <i>Lady Into Fox</i>. Other than the mysterious transformation of the woman, this short work is otherwise completely realistic, placing it in the category of contemporary fantasy or magic realism.</p>
			<p>Published in 1922, the book quickly attracted critical attention and praise. It won both the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners">James Tait Black Memorial Prize</a> and the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/hawthornden-prize-winners">Hawthornden Prize</a>, and was included by the writer Rebecca West in a list of the “best imaginative productions” of the 1920s alongside <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf">Virginia Woolf’s</a> <i>Orlando</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Lady Into Fox</i> was turned into a ballet in 1939 by the choreographer Andrée Howard, with music based on piano pieces by Arthur Hoenegger. Performed by Ballet Rambert, it was apparently a success.</p>
			<p>In 1960, a French writer using the pseudonym “Vercours” wrote a novel titled <i>Sylva</i> directly inspired by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/david-garnett">Garnett’s</a> novel, in which the reverse transformation occurs: a fox on the run from a hunt is transformed into a naked young woman, who is taken in and cared for by the owner of a nearby manor. This novel, translated into English, was nominated for Best Novel in the Hugo Awards presented by the World Science Fiction Convention in 1963.</p>

		<summary type="text">Dante journeys through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven in order to receive salvation and to find divine love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dante-alighieri">Dante Alighieri’s</a> <i>Divine Comedy</i> is considered one of the greatest works in world literature, and it established the standardized Italian language that is used today. Writing between 1308 and 1320, Dante draws from countless subjects including Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, the struggle between the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, Greek mythology, and geocentric cosmology to answer the age-old question: what does the afterlife look like? Dante’s vision of the answer, this three-volume epic poem, describes in great detail the systematic levels in Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.</p>
			<p>The poem opens with Dante’s death—not his actual death that would come shortly after his work’s completion, but his fictional death—where the author is found wandering in a dark forest. Blocked from climbing towards the bright light by a she-wolf, a leopard, and a lion, he is forced to walk further into the darkened valley and towards the gates of Hell. Dante and his guides must then travel through the nine circles of Hell, seven terraces of Purgatory, and nine spheres of Heaven to experience divine justice for earthly sins so that he may reach the Empyrean and receive God’s love. On his journey, he will learn that one must be consciously devoted to the path of morality and righteousness, else one find oneself on a path towards sin.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s blank verse translation. Longfellow succeeds in capturing the original brilliance of Dante’s internal rhymes and hypnotic patterns while also retaining accuracy. It is said that the death of his young wife brought him closer to the melancholy spirit of Dante’s writing, which itself was shaped by his wounding exile from his beloved Florence in 1302.</p>

		<summary type="text">Shipwrecked on a remote tropical island, a resourceful Englishman manages to survive alone for many years.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is one of the most popular books ever written in the English language, published in innumerable editions and translated into almost every language of the world, not to mention the many versions created in film, television and even radio. First published in 1719, it can also claim to be one of the first novels ever written in English.</p>
			<p>Written in the form of an autobiography, it describes the life of the eponymous narrator Robinson Crusoe. A wild youth, he breaks away from his family to go to sea. After many adventures including being captured and made into a slave, he is eventually shipwrecked on a remote island off the coast of South America. Crusoe is the only survivor of the wreck. He is thus forced to find ways to survive on the island without any other assistance. His first years are miserable and hard, but he ultimately manages to domesticate goats and raise crops, making his life tolerable. While suffering from an illness, he undergoes a profound religious conversion, and begins to ascribe his survival to a beneficent Providence.</p>
			<p>Crusoe lives alone on the island for more than twenty years until his life changes dramatically after he discovers a human footprint in the sand, indicating the undeniable presence of other human beings. These, it turns out, are the native inhabitants of the mainland, who visit the island only occasionally. To Crusoe’s horror, he discovers that these people practice cannibalism. He rescues one of their prisoners, who becomes his servant (or “man”) Friday, named for the day of the week on which he rescued him, and together, their adventures continue.</p>

		<summary type="text">An account of one man’s survival in London during the Great Plague of 1665.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The Plague is a disease that has a long and tragic history alongside humanity’s development of tightly-packed cities. <i>A Journal of a Plague Year</i> is a first-person narrative account of London’s last great plague outbreak in 1665, which killed an estimated 100,000 people in just 18 months.</p>
			<p>Though written in the first-person perspective by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, he was only 5 years old during the outbreak. The initials at the end of the work, “<abbr>H. F.</abbr>,” suggest that <i>Journal</i> is based on accounts of Defoe’s uncle, Henry Foe.</p>
			<p>This highly readable short novel is fascinating not just as a historical account, but in its description of how people reacted to a deadly disease that they understood to be contagious, but yet had no cure for. Defoe derides quack doctors who killed more than they saved, and then themselves succumbed to plague. He tells of people turning to religion; of people driven mad by the death around them and raving in the streets; of people fleeing to the country, and of others barricading themselves in their homes. The ways people reacted in 1665 could be the very same ways people might have reacted today to a mysterious, deadly, and highly contagious outbreak.</p>

		<summary type="text">A nine-year-old girl’s humorous depiction of high society, exactly as written in her notebook.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daisy-ashford">Daisy Ashford</a> was just nine years old when she penned (or rather, penciled) <i>The Young Visiters</i> in her notebook. As an adult, she found the manuscript along with other childhood writings and showed them to her literary friends for a laugh. They were so delighted that they passed them around their circle. The unexpected result was a publishing deal, with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-m-barrie"><abbr>J. M.</abbr> Barrie</a>, creator of Peter Pan, writing the preface. So clever was the book that some assumed Barrie himself had written the entire thing as an elaborate hoax.</p>
			<p>The story’s “hero” is Alfred Salteena, a polite but bumbling man who hopes to learn the ways of the elite. He is in love with a younger woman, Ethel, but a love triangle with his friend Bernard soon emerges. The characters attend “sumshious” balls, stay in lavish “compartments,” and wear elaborate “get ups,” all of it rendered in Ashford’s original childish spelling. The story reads like a pastiche of high society and even a parody of the Victorian novel.</p>
			<p><i>The Young Visiters</i> was published in 1919 and was reprinted eighteen times in that year alone. It has been adapted into a play, a musical, and multiple film versions. Ashford’s other juvenile writings were later published, including <i>The Hangman’s Daughter</i>, a short novel she considered her finest work. As an adult, she did not continue to write.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three generations of an English family struggle to adapt in a society rapidly changed by industrialization.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Rainbow</i> is an epic tale spanning three generations of Brangwens, a family of farmers living in Nottinghamshire around the time of the Industrial Revolution. The tale begins with Tom Brangwen, the very epitome of a rural English farmer leading the old way of life. We follow him as a youth easing in to the rhythm of rural existence. He soon falls in love with Lydia, a Polish immigrant he had hired as a housekeeper, and despite their vast cultural differences, the two marry. Their relationship is, in a word, satisfactory: the two face a language and culture barrier that prevents their minds from ever truly meeting, but they learn to be more or less content with their place in society and in raising their children.</p>
			<p>Lydia’s child by her first marriage, Anna, becomes the focus of the next part of the novel. She was born in England, and has a fiery and demanding temperament. She falls in love with Will, a nephew of Tom, and the two begin a rocky and difficult marriage. Will, a craftsman and not a farmer, is self-absorbed, and wants nothing more than for them to live their lives only for each other. But Anna wants to strike out in the world and become a part of society. The two must reconcile their clashing personalities and desires as they raise their many children.</p>
			<p>The oldest of their children, Ursula, becomes the focus of the last third—and perhaps most famous—part of the novel. Ursula is a deeply sensual being born in to the Victorian era, a time restrained in morality but exploding in energy and possibility, now worlds away from her grandfather Tom Brangwen’s quiet, traditional farming life. She leads a life unimaginable to her rural ancestors: indulging in travel abroad, waiting for marriage and pursuing her physical desires, and even taking on a career—a concept both new and frightening to her family, who are just a generation removed from the era when a woman’s life was led at home. Her unhappiness with the contradiction in this new unbridled way of living and the strict social mores of the era becomes the main theme of this last part of the book.</p>
			<p>The entire novel takes a frank approach to sexuality and physical desire, with sex portrayed unashamedly as a natural, powerful, pleasurable, and desirable force in relationships. In fact Ursula’s story is the most famous part of the novel not just because of her unrestrained physicality and lust, but because she also experiments with a candidly-realized homosexual affair with one of her teachers. This unheard-of treatment of deeply taboo topics was poorly received by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence">Lawrence’s</a> Edwardian contemporaries, and the book quickly became the subject of an obscenity trial that resulted in over 1,000 copies being burned and the book being banned in the U.K. for eleven years.</p>
			<p>Though its charged portrayal of sexuality is what the book is remembered for, sexuality is only one of the themes Lawrence treats. The novel stands solidly on its rich description of both rural and city life, its wide-angled view of change over generations, and its exploration of hope for the human spirit in societies that heave not gently but quickly and violently into new eras.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man from a working-class English coal miner’s family struggles to reconcile romantic and familial love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i>, a story of working-class England, is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence"><abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence’s</a> third novel. It went through various drafts, and was titled “Paul Morel” until the final draft, before being published and met with an indifferent reaction from contemporary critics. Modern critics now consider it to be <abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence’s masterpiece, with the Modern Library placing it ninth in its “100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century.”</p>
			<p>The novel follows the Morels, a family living in a coal town, and headed by a passionate but boorish miner. His wife, originally from a refined family, is dragged down by Morel’s classlessness, and finds her life’s joy in her children. As the children grow up and start leading lives of their own, they struggle against their mother’s emotional drain on them.</p>
			<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> was written during a period in Lawrence’s life when his own mother was gravely ill. Its exploration of the Oedipal instinct, frank depiction of working-class household unhappiness and violence, and accurate and colorful depiction of Nottinghamshire dialect, make it a fascinating window into the life of people not often chronicled in fiction of the day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A precocious boy grows to adulthood while struggling with both his own and society’s expectations of his role in life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Michael Fane arrives in the thin red house in Carlington Road to his new family of Nurse, Cook, Annie the housemaid, his younger sister Stella, and the occasional presence of Mother. From here, the novel follows the next twenty years of his life as he tries to find his place in the upper echelons of Edwardian society, through prep school, studies at Oxford, and his emergence into the wide world. The setting is rich in period detail, and the characters portrayed are vivid and more nuanced in their actions and stories than first impressions imply.</p>
			<p><i>Sinister Street</i> was an immediate critical success on publication, although not without some worry for its openness to discuss less salubrious scenes, and it was a favourite of George Orwell and John Betjeman. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/compton-mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a> had attended both <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ school and <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary’s College at Oxford and the novel is at least partly autobiographical, but for the same measure was praised as an accurate portrayal of that experience; <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/max-beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a> said “There is no book on Oxford like it. It gives you the actual Oxford experience.” Although originally published in two volumes (in 1913 and 1914) for commercial reasons, the two form a single novel and have been brought back together again for this edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">Cicero gives practical guidance for living wisely and well by adopting a Stoic outlook and concentrating on the virtues.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/cicero">Cicero</a> composed these discourses while in his villa in Tusculum as he was mourning the death of his daughter, in order to convey his philosophy of how to live wisely and well. They take the form of fictional dialogues between Cicero and his friends, with each one focusing on a particular Stoic theme. The first, “On the Contempt of Death,” reminds us that mortality is nothing to be upset about. The second, “On Bearing Pain,” reassures us that philosophy is a balm for pains of the body. The third and fourth, “On Grief of Mind” and “Other Perturbations of the Mind,” say that this extends also to mental anguish and unrest. The last, “Whether Virtue Alone Be Sufficient for a Happy Life,” tells us that the key to happiness is already in our hands: it is not to rely on accidents of fate, but on our own efforts in areas of life that are under our own control.</p>

		<summary type="text">39-year-old Helen McGill—disgruntled with her life tending to her brother and his farm—becomes the unlikely owner of a traveling bookseller’s wagon, and travels across the New England countryside spreading love and the joy of reading.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Parnassus on Wheels</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/christopher-morley">Christopher Morley’s</a> first novel, and the first of two written from a woman’s perspective, the second being <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/christopher-morley/the-haunted-bookshop"><i>The Haunted Bookshop</i></a>, this book’s sequel. <i>Parnassus on Wheels</i> was inspired by a novel by David Grayson (pseudonym of Ray Stannard Baker) called <i>The Friendly Road</i>, and is prefaced by a letter to Grayson from Morley. The word “Parnassus” from the title refers to “Mount Parnassus,” the home of the Muses in Greek mythology.</p>
			<p>The protagonist is 39-year-old Helen McGill, who lives on a farm owned by her brother Andrew. The book’s Parnassus is a large, horse-drawn van owned by Roger Mifflin, out of which he buys and sells books while traveling around the New England countryside. Mifflin arrives at the McGill farm, looking to sell the business to someone interested in the noble cause of spreading literature to the common man. Helen is at first turned off by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mifflin, but decides on a whim that an escape from her dreadful farm—and her insufferable brother Andrew—is just what she needs. She buys the Parnassus, and embarks on exactly the type of adventure she had hoped for.</p>

		<summary type="text">Dr. Faustus sells his soul to Lucifer in return for magical powers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/christopher-marlowe">Christopher Marlowe’s</a> classic interpretation of the <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Faustus legend, was first performed in London by the Admiral’s Men around 1592. It is believed to be the first dramatization of this classic tale wherein Faustus, a German scholar, trades his soul to Lucifer in return for magical powers and the command over the demon Mephistopheles. Faustus at first seeks to expand his knowledge of the universe, but soon finds that a deal with the devil brings little satisfaction. All too soon the contract expires, and Faustus is faced with the prospect of eternal damnation.</p>
			<p>Two principal versions of this play exist, one based on the 1604 quarto (the A text) and a longer, emended version published in 1616 (the B text). This edition is based on Havelock Ellis’s 1893 edition of the 1604 text (the A text is currently believed by many scholars to be the closest to Marlowe’s original).</p>
			<p>Often considered to be Marlowe’s greatest work, <i>Doctor Faustus</i> builds on the ancestry of the medieval morality play, but brings a more sympathetic view to the straying hero than those precursors to Elizabethan drama, and even ventures to pose questions of common Christian doctrine. This is the last play written by Marlowe before he was killed in a Deptford tavern.</p>

		<summary type="text">After losing all of his possessions, a Jewish merchant is determined to get his revenge on Malta.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/christopher-marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> wrote <i>The Jew of Malta</i> at the height of his career, and it remained popular until England’s theaters were closed by Parliament in 1642. Many have critiqued it for its portrayal of Elizabethan antisemitism, but others argue that Marlowe criticizes Judaism, Islam, and Christianity equally for their hypocrisy. This antisemitism debate continues on to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, which was written about ten years later and which some consider to be directly influenced by <i>The Jew of Malta</i>.</p>
			<p>The play focuses on a wealthy Jewish merchant named Barabas who lives on the island of Malta. When the island’s governor strips Barabas of all his wealth in order to pay off the invading Turks, Barabas plots and schemes to get his revenge, killing all who get in his way and ultimately pitting Spanish Christians against Ottoman Muslims in an attempt to punish them all.</p>
			<p>Scholars dispute the authorship of the play, with some suggesting that the last half was written by a different author. Though the play is known to have been performed as early as 1594, the earliest surviving print edition is from 1633, which includes a prologue and epilogue written by another playwright for a planned revival.</p>

		<summary type="text">Gilman explores the transformation of the role of women in society and the necessity for women to achieve economic independence.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-perkins-gilman">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</a>, most famous for her short story “The Yellow Wallpaper,” wrote <i>Women and Economics</i> in 1898, at a time when the roles of women in society were already undergoing radical change: women were entering the work force in large numbers, the suffrage movement was agitating for the vote, and young women were looking for a new definition of their place other than as a wife or mother.</p>
			<p>The book takes the position that humans are the only species in which the female depends on the male for her survival, and that this arrangement must change for the human race to continue to be successful. Gilman argues for the evolution of marriage, family, home life, and what she calls the sexuo-economic relationship between men and women.</p>
			<p>Although she was in demand as a lecturer and writer, <i>Women and Economics</i> was the first book-length work to consolidate her views. As a feminist text, it’s significant not necessarily for its profundity or for its appeal for women’s rights, but rather for its application of social Darwinism, espousing the theory that the roles played by women inevitably evolve and that the gendered division of labor produces warped human beings of both sexes. Its popularity was also helped by its accessibility—as one of her critics stated, “it stirs no deep reverberations of the soul … but you can quote it, and remember its points.”</p>
			<p>As suffragism progressed and first wave feminism began to fade, Gilman’s ideas were somewhat forgotten. But as feminism resurged in the 1960s, her work was rediscovered and interest rebounded in this groundbreaking feminist who played an important role in shaping public opinion, disseminating radical ideas, and encouraging women (and men) to change their thinking about gender roles.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three male explorers trek into a mysterious civilization populated entirely by women.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Three male explorers set out to reach a legendary land where only women live, and find—to their surprise—that the legends are true. This country hidden in the mountains is a feminist utopia. There are no men, nor is there war, poverty, or crime. The residents subsist on food from cultivated forests, maintain immaculate houses and roads, and reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis. Although the main characters are men, their role is to show us how their notions about society and womanhood are humorously upturned.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-perkins-gilman">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</a> was an outspoken activist and suffragist, most famous nowadays for her short story “The Yellow Wallpaper.” As a writer, she was stunningly prolific. She founded <i>The Forerunner</i>, a monthly magazine for which she personally wrote every article, story, and poem. Because she chose to run no advertisements, she covered the cost of printing the magazine herself. In contrast to many women’s publications of the day, Gilman advocated for equal rights and expanded social roles for women.</p>
			<p>Originally published serially in <i>The Forerunner</i> in 1915, <i>Herland</i> was not republished as a standalone work until decades later. It is the second in Gilman’s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/utopian-trilogy">Utopian trilogy</a>, along with <i>Moving the Mountain</i> and <i>With Her in Ourland</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman travels from England to the fictional town of Villette where she makes new connections and encounters people from her past.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-bronte">Charlotte Brontë’s</a> last novel, <i>Villette</i>, is thought to be most closely modelled on her own experiences teaching in a <i>pensionnat</i> in Brussels, the place on which the fictional town of Villette is based. In the novel, first published in 1853, we follow the protagonist Lucy Snowe from the time she is fourteen and lives with her godmother in rural England, through her family tragedies and departure for the town of Villette where she finds work at a French boarding school. People from her past reappear in dramatic ways, she makes new connections, and she learns the stories and secrets of the people around her. Through it all, the reader is made privy to Lucy’s thoughts, feelings, and journey of self-discovery.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor boy, born and raised in a workhouse in Victorian England, falls into the control of a gang of heartless criminals.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Oliver Twist, or The Parish Boy’s Progress</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens’</a> second novel, following <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, and was published as a serial in the magazine <i>Bentley’s Miscellany</i> between 1837 and 1839. It details the misadventures of its eponymous character, Oliver Twist, born in a Victorian-era workhouse, his mother dying within minutes of his birth. He is raised in miserable conditions, half-starved, and then sent out as an apprentice to an undertaker. Running away from this situation, he walks to London and falls under the influence of a criminal gang run by an old man called Fagin, who wants to employ the child as a pickpocket.</p>
			<p>The novel graphically depicts the wretched living conditions of much of the poor people of Victorian times and the disgusting slums in which they were forced to live. It has been accused of perpetrating anti-Semitic stereotypes in the character of Fagin, almost always referred to as “the Jew” in the book’s early chapters. Interestingly, while the serial was still running in the magazine, Dickens was eventually persuaded that he was wrong in this and removed many such usages in later episodes. He also introduced more kindly Jewish characters in such later novels as <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Oliver Twist</i> was immediately popular in serial form, with its often gripping story and lurid details. It has remained one of Dicken’s best-loved novels, and the story has often been made into films and television series, as well as into a very popular musical, <i>Oliver!</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">After returning home from a long period spent working in China, a man tries to assist a family forced to live in a debtor’s prison.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Little Dorrit</i>, like many of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens’</a> novels, was originally published in serial form over a period of about 18 months, before appearing in book form in 1857.</p>
			<p>The novel focuses on the experiences of its protagonist Arthur Clenham, who has spent some twenty years in China helping his father run the family business there. After his father dies, Arthur returns home to London. His mother gives him little in the way of welcome. She is a cold, bitter woman who has brought Arthur up under a strict religious regime concentrating on the punitive aspects of the Old Testament. Despite this upbringing, or perhaps in reaction to it, Arthur is a kind, considerate man. He is intrigued by a slight young woman he encounters working as a part-time seamstress for his mother, whom his mother calls simply “Little Dorrit.” Arthur senses some mystery about her mother’s employment of Little Dorrit, and proceeds to investigate.</p>
			<p>There are several subplots and a whole host of characters. Compared to some of Dickens’ work, <i>Little Dorrit</i> features a good deal of intrigue and tension. There are also some strong strands of humor, in the form of the fictional “Circumlocution Office,” whose sole remit is “How Not To Do It,” and which stands in the way of any improvement of British life. Also very amusing are the rambling speeches of Flora, a woman with whom Arthur was enamored before he left for China, but whose shallowness he now perceives only too well.</p>
			<p><i>Little Dorrit</i> has been adapted for the screen many times, and by the BBC in 2010 in a limited television series which featured Claire Foy as Little Dorrit, Matthew Macfayden as Arthur Clenham, and Andy Serkis as the villain Rigaud.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wealthy man in the industrial north of England raises his children on purely rational principles, with unfortunate results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Hard Times</i> (originally <i>Hard Times—For These Times</i>) was published in 1854, and is the shortest novel <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</a> ever published. It’s set in Coketown, a fictional mill-town set in the north of England. One of the major themes of the book is the miserable treatment of workers in the mills, and the resistance to their unionization by the mill owners, typified by the character Josiah Bounderby, who absurdly asserts that the workers live a near-idyllic life but they all “expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon.” The truth, of course, is far different.</p>
			<p>The other major topic which Dickens tackles in this novel is the rationalist movement in schooling and the denigration of imagination and fantasy. It begins with the words “Now, what I want is, Facts,” spoken by the wealthy magnate Thomas Gradgrind, who is supervising a class at a model school he has opened. This indeed is Gradgrind’s entire philosophy. “Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.” He is supported and encouraged in this approach by his friend Bounderby. Grandgrind raises his own children on these principles, and, as we discover, in doing so blights their lives.</p>
			<p>The novel also follows the story of a particular mill-worker, Stephen Blackpool, who leads a tragic life. He is burdened with an alcoholic, slatternly wife, who is mostly absent from his life, but who returns at irregular intervals to trouble him. This existing marriage, and the near-impossibility of divorce for someone of his class, prevents him marrying Rachael, who is the light of his life. Dickens depicts Stephen as representing the nobility of honest work, and contrasts his character with that of the self-satisfied humbug Josiah Bounderby who represents the worst aspects of capitalism.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphan boy living in Victorian England begins his life in extreme poverty and goes on to experience good fortune, love, rejection, wealth, and social challenges as he grows into adulthood.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</a> was a British author, journalist, and editor whose work brought attention to the struggles of Victorian England’s lower classes.

			<p>The novel follows the life, relationships, and moral development of an orphan boy named Pip. The novel begins when Pip encounters an escaped convict whom he helps and fears in equal measure. Pip’s actions that day set off a sequence of events and interactions that shape Pip’s character as he matures into adulthood.</p>
			<p>The vivid characters, engaging narrative style, and universal themes of <i>Great Expectations</i> establish this novel as a timeless literary classic, and an engaging portrait of Victorian life.</p>

		<summary type="text">The semi-autobiographical tale of a young boy who rises up to become a successful novelist.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Like many of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Dickens’</a> works, <i>David Copperfield</i> was published serially, then as a complete novel for the first time in 1850. Dickens himself thought of it as his favorite novel, writing in the preface that of all his works <i>Copperfield</i> was his favorite child. This isn’t surprising, considering that many of the events in the novel are semi-autobiographical accounts from Dickens’ own life.</p>
			<p>In <i>David Copperfield</i> we follow the life of the titular character as he makes a life for himself in England. He finds himself in the care of a cold stepfather who sends him to boarding school, and from there embarks on a journey filled with characters and events that can only be called “Dickensian” in their colorful and just-barely-probable portrayals.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman of uncertain parentage is taken in by a kindly guardian, while her fate and that of two other young people hinge on the outcome of an interminable legal case.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Bleak House</i>, completed by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Dickens</a> in 1853, tells several interlocking story-lines and features a host of colorful characters. Though very difficult to summarise, the novel centers around the decades-long legal case of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i>, involving the fair distribution of assets of a valuable estate. The case is mired in the legal quagmire of the Court of Chancery, whose byzantine and sluggish workings Dickens spares no effort to expose and condemn. Dickens also exposes the miserable condition of the poor, living in squalid, pestilential circumstances.</p>
			<p>The novel’s heroine is Esther Summerson, whose parentage is unclear and who has been brought up by a cold and strict godmother, who tells her only: “Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.” On the death of her godmother, she is given an education through the unexpected intervention of a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarndyce of Bleak House, whom she has never met. When she comes of age, she is appointed as a companion to Ada, one of two young people who are “wards of Chancery,” whose fates depend on the outcome of the legal struggle and who are taken into guardianship by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarndyce. The other ward Richard, despite <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarndyce’s frequent warnings, eventually goes astray by pinning all his hopes on a successful outcome of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i>.</p>
			<p>We are also introduced to Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, and to their cunning and suspicious lawyer, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tulkinghorn. He uncovers evidence that Lady Dedlock is not all she seems and determines to remorselessly pursue every lead to expose her secrets.</p>
			<p>The novel has a curious construction in that the first-person narrative of Esther, written in the past tense, is interleaved with many chapters written from the omniscient viewpoint and in the present tense.</p>
			<p>Several prominent critics such as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton"><abbr>G. K.</abbr> Chesterton</a> consider <i>Bleak House</i> to be Dickens’ finest novel, and it is often ranked among the best English-language novels of all time.</p>

		<summary type="text">A family is reunited, added to, and then threatened to be torn apart by events arising from the French Revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A doctor is released from the Bastille after being falsely imprisoned for almost eighteen years. A young woman discovers the father she’s never known is not dead but alive, if not entirely well. A young man is acquitted of being a traitor, due in part to the efforts of a rather selfish lout who is assisting the young man’s attorney. A man has a wine shop in Paris with a wife who knits at the bar. These disparate elements are tied together as only <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Dickens</a> can, and in the process he tells the story of the French Revolution.</p>
			<p>Charles Dickens was fascinated by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-carlyle">Thomas Carlyle’s</a> magnum opus <i>The French Revolution</i>; according to Dickens’ letters, he read it “500 times” and carried it with him everywhere while he was working on this novel. When he wrote to Carlyle asking him for books to read on background, Carlyle sent him two cartloads full. Dickens mimicked Carlyle’s style, his chronology, and his overall characterization of the revolution; although <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is fiction, the historical events described are largely accurate, sometimes exactly so. Even so, Dickens made his name and reputation on telling stories full of characters one could be invested in, care about, and despise, and this novel has all of those and more. It also, in its first and last lines, has two of the most famous lines in literature. With the possible exception of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></a>, it is his most popular novel, and according to many, his best.</p>

		<summary type="text">A miserly moneylender is visited by four ghosts who help him see how to honor Christmas in his heart all year round.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</a> wrote <i>A Christmas Carol</i> in 1843 and the first edition, published on 19th December, was so successful that it sold out in just six days. The publishers had to produce two further editions between Christmas and the new year to meet the demand, and the novella has never been out of print.</p>
			<p><em>A Christmas Carol</em> tells the story of a greedy money-lender, Ebeneezer Scrooge, who is first visited by the ghost of his former business partner and then by three spirits—the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. They show Scrooge’s lack of compassion to him, compelling him to act more compassionately in the future and to honor Christmas in his heart.</p>

		<summary type="text">A distinguished amateur scientist lays out the evidence for the origin of species by means of natural selection.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-darwin">Charles Darwin</a> must rank as one of the most influential and consequential books ever published, initiating scientific, social and religious ferment ever since its first publication in 1859. Its full title is <i>The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i>, in some editions prefaced by the word “On.”</p>
			<p>Darwin describes the book as simply an “abstract” of his ideas, which are more fully fleshed out and supported with detailed examples in his other, more scholarly works (for example, he wrote several long treatises entirely about barnacles). <i>The Origin of Species</i> itself was intended to reach a wider audience and is written in such a way that any reasonably educated and thoughtful reader can follow Darwin’s argument that species of animals and plants are not independent creations, fixed for all time, but mutable. Species have been shaped in response to the effects of natural selection, which Darwin compares to the directed or manual selection by human breeders of domesticated animals.</p>
			<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> was eagerly taken up by the reading public, and rapidly went through several editions. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on the sixth edition published by John Murray in 1872, generally considered to be the definitive edition with many amendments and updates by Darwin himself.</p>
			<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> has never been out of print and continues to be an extremely popular work. Later scientific discoveries such as the breakthrough of DNA sequencing have refined our concept of some of Darwin’s ideas and given us a better understanding of issues he found puzzling, but the basic thrust of his theory remains unchallenged.</p>

		<summary type="text">The eminent Victorian scientist and mathematician on his inventions, dreams and adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-babbage">Charles Babbage</a> was a Victorian polymath, and someone with a seemingly never-ending intellectual curiosity about the world around him. A mathematician by training, he also wrote copiously on subjects such as economics, physics, engineering, computation, cryptography, religion and education, along with conducting practical experiments with pretty much anything that had grabbed his interest at the time. Today, he’s widely viewed to be the father of the computer with his Difference and Analytical Engines. Although neither were fully completed during his lifetime, a working replica of the Difference Engine was built in the 1990s, and an Analytical Engine is currently in the planning stages.</p>
			<p>This autobiography (first published near the end of his life in 1864) veers from topic to topic and rarely settles on any subject for more than a chapter. Apart from his early life and an explanation of the thinking behind his computing Engines, Babbage also transcribes his memories of climbing into an active volcano, arguing with street musicians, picking locks, standing in elections, and imagining life as a cheese mite, among other diverse subjects. The original meaning of the titular word “Philosopher” is “lover of wisdom,” and this book shows Babbage to be just that.</p>

		<summary type="text">Young Tom Corbett finally realizes his dream of becoming a Space Cadet but soon he and his classmates find themselves fighting to stay alive in the harsh Martian desert.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Inspired by Robert <abbr>A.</abbr> Heinlein’s 1948 novel <i>Space Cadet</i>, the Tom Corbett series started as a TV show in 1950. It stayed on the air for five years and, among other things, spawned a series of novels published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Written by unknown authors, they were published under the pseudonym <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/carey-rockwell">Carey Rockwell</a>, with Willy Ley (the TV show’s technical director) listed as technical advisor.</p>
			<p><i>Stand by for Mars!</i> is the first of eight novels written between 1952 and 1956. It features a young Tom Corbett who is trying to fulfill his dream of becoming a Space Cadet on his way to joining the Solar Guard. But interpersonal conflicts stand in his way. Tom, along with his unit-mates Astro and Roger Manning, must find a way past their difficulties or else risk being washed out. Their adventure takes them from the rigours of the Academy on Earth to the rugged and deadly deserts of Mars where they need to learn that only by working together can they hope to survive.</p>
			<p>An entire generation grew up on the adventures of Tom Corbett—it spawned radio shows, music recordings and a whole series of toys and tie-ins. Fans still maintain a Tom Corbett Space Cadet website and have held reunions as recently as 2006. <i>Stand by for Mars!</i> is a classic example of the space-crazy juvenile fiction of its era.</p>

		<summary type="text">A comet threatens to collide with the Earth, perhaps bringing about the end of the world.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Born in 1842, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/camille-flammarion">Camille Flammarion</a> was a French astronomer who wrote many popular books about science and astronomy, together with a number of novels which we would now consider to be science fiction. He was a contemporary of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne">Jules Verne</a>, though his works never achieved their level of popularity.</p>
			<p><i>Omega: The Last Days of the World</i> is an English translation of Flammarion’s novel <i lang="fr">La Fin du Monde</i>, published in 1893. The book’s fictional premise is the discovery of a comet on a collision course with the Earth in the 25th century. However, this is mostly a pretext on which Flammarion can hang his interesting scientific speculations about how the world will end, together with philosophical thoughts about war and religion. Much of the scientific description he uses in the book, while accurately representing the knowledge and thinking of his time, has today been superseded by modern discoveries. For example, we now know the source of the Sun’s energy to be nuclear fusion rather than being due to gravitational contraction and the constant infall of meteorites.</p>
			<p>When talking about the ills of society, however, Flammarion could well be talking about today’s world. For example, he excoriates the vast waste of society’s resources on war, and demonstrates how much more productive each nation’s economy would be without it. He also depicts the media of his future world as having been entirely taken over by commercial interests, publishing only what will excite the greatest number of readers rather than serving the public interest.</p>
			<p><i>Omega</i> ranges over a vast period of time, from prehistory through to millions of years in the future when mankind has been reduced to the last two doomed individuals. Nevertheless, the book ends on a hopeful and inspiring note.</p>

		<summary type="text">A swashbuckling adventure on the fabled continent of Atlantis.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Lost Continent</i>, initially published as a serial in 1899, remains one of the enduring classics of the “lost race” genre. In it we follow Deucalion, a warrior-priest on the lost continent of Atlantis, as he tries to battle the influence of an egotistical upstart empress. Featuring magic, intrigue, mythical monsters, and fearsome combat on both land and sea, the story is nothing if not a swashbuckling adventure.</p>
			<p><i>The Lost Continent</i> was very influential on pulp fiction of the subsequent decades, and echoes of its style can be found in the work of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-e-howard">Robert <abbr>E.</abbr> Howard</a>, and others.</p>

		<summary type="text">An ancient undead monster terrorizes Victorian London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the most famous public-domain horror novels in existence, responsible not just for introducing the eponymous Count Dracula, but for introducing many of the common tropes we see in modern horror fiction.</p>
			<p>Count Dracula isn’t the first vampire to have graced the pages of literature—that honor is thought to belong to Lord Ruthven in <i>The Vampyr</i>, by John William Polidori—but Dracula is the vampire on which modern vampires are based.</p>
			<p><i>Dracula</i> wasn’t as famous in its day as it is today; readers of the time seemed to enjoy it as nothing more than a good story, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker">Stoker</a> died nearly penniless. But its long-lasting influence is undeniable, and for all its age <i>Dracula</i> remains a gripping, fast-paced, and enjoyable read.</p>

			<p>The Sheridan family moves to a house next door to the old-money Vertrees family, whose fortunes have declined precipitously in this new era’s thirst for industry. Bibbs makes fast friends with Mary, Vertrees’ daughter; but as he tries to make a life for himself as a poet and writer, away from the cutthroat world of business, he must face off against the relentless drum of money, growth, and Bigness that has consumed American small-town life.</p>
			<p><i>The Turmoil</i> is the first book in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington">Tarkington’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/growth-trilogy">Growth trilogy</a>, a series that explores the destruction of traditional small-town America in favor of industrialization, pollution, automobiles, overcrowding, and suburbia. Tarkington makes no secret of his opinion on the matter: the trilogy is filled with acrid smoke, towering buildings crammed with people, noise and deadly accidents caused by brand-new cars, brutal working conditions, and a yearning for the clean, bright, slow, dignified days of yore.</p>
			<p>The book was made in to two silent films just eight years apart from each other. Its sequel, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington/the-magnificent-ambersons">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i>, went on to win the Pulitzer prize in 1919.</p>

		<summary type="text">The scion of an old-money Midwestern family must cope with their waning fortunes and the changes brought on by industry and the automobile age.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, winner of the 1919 Pulitzer prize, is considered by many to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington">Booth Tarkington’s</a> finest novel and an American classic. The story is set in the Midwest, where George, the spoiled and oblivious scion of an old-money family, must cope with their waning fortunes and the rise of industry barons in the automobile age.</p>
			<p>George’s antiheroic struggles with modernity encapsulate a greater theme of change and renewal—specifically, the very American notion of a small community exploding into a dark and dirty city virtually overnight by virtue of industrial “progress.” Tarkington’s nuanced portrayal of the often-unlikable Amberson family and his paradoxical framing of progress as a destroyer of family, community, and environment, make <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> a fascinating and forward-thinking novel—certainly one with a permanent place in the American social canon. Despite the often heavy themes, Tarkington’s prose remains uniquely witty, charming, and brisk.</p>
			<p>The novel is the second in Tarkington’s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/growth-trilogy">Growth trilogy</a> of novels, and has been adapted several times for radio, film, and television, including a 1942 Orson Welles adaptation that many consider one of the finest American films ever made.</p>

		<summary type="text">A businessman struggles to bring the modernity of the suburban industrial age to a Midwestern town.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>National Avenue</i>, originally titled <i>The Midlander</i>, is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington">Booth Tarkington’s</a> final entry in his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/growth-trilogy">Growth Trilogy</a>. Like the previous entries in the series, <i>National Avenue</i> addresses the rapid industrialization of small-town America at the turn of the century, and the socioeconomic changes that such change brings with it.</p>
			<p>Dan Oliphant and his brother Harlan are the children of a wealthy small-town businessman. Harlan is a traditional upper-class man—affecting an accent, dressing for dinner, and contemplating beauty and culture—while Dan is boisterous and lively, eager to do big things. Dan sees the rise of industry in America’s east as a harbinger for his own Midwestern town, and sets his mind on building an industrial suburb, Ornaby Addition, next to his city’s downtown.</p>
			<p>Dan’s idea is met with scorn and mockery from not only his family, but also his fellow townspeople. Dan persists nonetheless, and soon the town must contend with his dream becoming a reality: noisy cars, smoky factories, huge, unappealing buildings, and the destruction of nature and the environment become the new normal as Dan’s industrial dream is realized.</p>
			<p>Where <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington/the-turmoil">The Turmoil</a></i> focuses on industrialization’s effect on art and culture, and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington/the-magnificent-ambersons">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i> focuses on industry’s destruction of family and of small-town life, <i>National Avenue</i> focuses on the men and women who actually bring that change about. Dan is portrayed sympathetically, but Tarkington makes it clear that his dreams and choices lead to a deeply unhappy family life and the ruination of the land around him. But can Dan really be faulted for his dream, or is industry inevitable, and inevitably destructive?</p>

		<summary type="text">The autobiography of Booker T. Washington, former slave and founder of the Tuskegee Institute.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booker-t-washington">Booker Taliaferro Washington</a> began life as a slave in Virginia shortly before emancipation, but rose to become one of the most celebrated leaders the African American community has ever had. His principal occupation was as president of the Tuskegee Institute, which he founded in 1881, but he earned national renown as an orator, writer and political advisor. His address at the Atlanta Exposition was a pivotal moment in race relations in America.</p>
			<p>Washington believed deeply in the dignity of physical labor, and that merit and talent are eventually rewarded regardless of race or class. The Tuskegee Institution was primarily a technical college, and aimed to teach industrial skills in addition to academic training. Students built many of the buildings on the campus, grew the food that was eaten there, and even made the furniture, tools and vehicles used by the school.</p>
			<p><i>Up from Slavery</i> was originally published as a serialized work in <i>The Outlook</i>, a Christian magazine based in New York, before being collected in a single volume in 1901. This edition includes an introduction by Walter <abbr>H.</abbr> Page, a future U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p>

		<summary type="text">The autobiography of Black Hawk, the famous leader of the Native American Sauk tribe and central figure in the Black Hawk War of 1832.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/black-hawk">Black Hawk</a>, so named after the sacred medicine bag he carried with him, was a warrior and a leader of a tribe of Sauk Native Americans in the American Midwest circa 1800. He rose to leadership during a tumultuous time for his people, as they were pressed on all sides by the warlike British, the ruthlessly expansionist Americans, and the grudges and jealousies of neighboring tribes.</p>
			<p>He lived as a warrior for much of his early life, when the War of 1812 between the British and the Americans forced the Sauk to take sides and enter the fray. Angered by the Americans’ demands they sign shaky treaties to cede their land, the tribe fought for the British until the toll of the war forced the tribe to bow out.</p>
			<p>After the war, Black Hawk signed a peace treaty with the Americans, but a series of misunderstandings once again brought tensions between the Sauk and the Americans to a head. When a group of under-trained Illinois militia mistakenly opened fire on the Sauk, Black Hawk began what is known as the Black Hawk War, leading raids against American forts and settlements in an effort to reclaim their ancient land.</p>
			<p>Even though Black Hawk managed to convince other tribes to join his cause, the war was quickly lost and Black Hawk captured. He was then taken on a tour of the vast East Coast cities in an attempt to impress upon him America’s overwhelming might. Despite his status as a former enemy, he was treated with dignity and respect by his captors before they granted him a small house and plot of land in Iowa to live out the rest of his days.</p>
			<p>His autobiography was dictated to a translator, Antoine Le Clair, and written down by his amanuensis and publisher, J. B. Patterson. The story Black Hawk tells is a vivid one of life on the prairie, rich with tradition and meaning, but riven equally by war and bloodshed. As he reminisces about the bucolic life he and his ancestors once led and compares it with the hardships his people are facing, his sorrow becomes palpable; and as his days draw to a close, the reader sees that even to Black Hawk, the fate of his people appears inevitable.</p>

		<summary type="text">A beginner’s guide to problems in various fields of philosophy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Problems of Philosophy</i>, published in 1912, is an introductory book for a beginner in philosophical studies. In this book, the author attempts to provoke a discussion by posing different problems.</p>
			<p>The book covers a wide variety of theories proposed by philosophers like Plato, Descartes, Hume, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <abbr>etc.</abbr> In view of these theories, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bertrand-russell">Russell</a> poses questions about the nature of reality and our perception of it.</p>
			<p>While the book refrains from providing absolute solutions to the problems it describes, it excels in guiding the readers towards developing their own way of thinking.</p>

		<summary type="text">Benjamin Franklin writes about his youth, adventures, and achievements.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> is a man who needs little introduction. He wore many hats over the course of his fascinating life, from that of a printer, to an inventor, to a scientist, to a politician, a founding father and statesman, and even a postmaster-general. He was famous for all of these things in his day, but he was also famed for his keen insight into people and human nature, and his sparkling talent as a conversationalist.</p>
			<p>Despite his accomplishments, Franklin seemed to keep a down-to-earth demeanor, favoring home-spun sayings and simple, direct, honest prose—the kind of prose that shines in this autobiography.</p>
			<p>The autobiography itself has a long and complex publication history. Franklin composed it in fits and spurts between 1771 and 1790, and never had a chance to complete it, let alone publish it, in his lifetime. It was first published as a poor French translation of an unrevised edition of the manuscript, and then as a heavily-editorialized and inaccurate English edition by Franklin’s son, William Temple Franklin. In 1868 John Bigelow purchased the original copy of the autobiography and published the first accurate edition, which is what subsequent publications, including this one, are based on.</p>
			<p>Though incomplete, this autobiography is a highly readable and fascinating insight into the legendary life of the man some people call the “First American.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A young nobleman is moved by the condition of the poor in England, and falls in love with a labourer’s daughter.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> was a remarkable historical figure. Born into a Jewish family, he converted to Anglican Christianity as a child. He is now almost certainly most famous for his political career. Becoming a member of the British Parliament at the age of 33, he initially rose to prominence within the Conservative (“Tory”) party because of his clashes with the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. Rising to lead the Conservative Party, Disraeli became Prime Minister for a short period in 1868, and then for an extended period between 1874 and 1880. He became friendly with Queen Victoria and was appointed Earl of Beaconsfield by her in 1876.</p>
			<p>However, Disraeli was much more than a politician. He wrote both political treatises and no less than seventeen novels during his lifetime, of which <i>Sybil, or The Two Nations</i> is now among the best regarded. The “Two Nations” of the subtitle refer to the divisions in Britain between the rich and the poor, each of whom might as well be living in a different country from the other. In the novel, Disraeli highlights the terrible living conditions of the poor and the shocking injustices of how they were treated by most employers and land-owners. He contrasts this with the frivolous, pampered lifestyles of the aristocracy. He covers the rise of the Chartist movement, which was demanding universal manhood suffrage—the right for all adult men to vote, regardless of whether they owned property—and other reforms to enable working men a voice in the government of the country. (Female suffrage was to come much later). The upheavals of the time led to the development of the People’s Charter and a massive petition with millions of signatures being presented to Parliament. However the Parliament of the time refused to even consider the petition, triggering violent protests in Birmingham and elsewhere. All of this is well covered and explained in the novel.</p>
			<p><i>Sybil</i> is rather disjointed in structure as it ranges over these different topics, but the main plot revolves around Egremont, the younger son of a nobleman, who encounters some of the leaders of the workers’ movement and in particular Walter Gerard, one of the most respected of these leaders, whom Egremont befriends while concealing his real name and social position. During visits to Gerard under an assumed name, Egremont falls for the beautiful and saintly Sybil, Gerard’s daughter, but she rejects him when his true identity is exposed. Sybil subsequently undergoes many difficult trials as the people’s movement develops and comes into conflict with the authorities.</p>

		<summary type="text">A rollicking Elizabethan comedy in which two con men and their female compatriot gull a series of unfortunate victims out of their money.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>First performed in 1610, <i>The Alchemist</i> is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ben-jonson">Ben Jonson’s</a> greatest comedies. Written for the King’s Men—the acting company to which <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> belonged—it was first performed in Oxford because the playhouses in London were closed due to the plague. It was an immediate success and has remained a popular staple ever since.</p>
			<p>The play centers around a con man, his female accomplice, and a roguish butler who uses his master’s house to gull a series of victims out of their money and goods. Jonson uses the play to satirize as many people as he can—pompous lords, greedy commoners, and self-righteous Anabaptists alike—as his three con artists proceed to bilk everyone who comes to their door. They don multiple roles and weave elaborate tales to exploit their victims’ greed and amass a small fortune. But it all comes to a sudden, raucous end when the master unexpectedly returns to London and all the victims gather to try and reclaim their property.</p>

		<summary type="text">A woman is kidnapped in order to trap her husband.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At one of Robespierre’s “Fraternal Suppers,” a young man denounces Robespierre but is saved by an asthmatic vagabond. The young man flees to the home of his friend Theresia Cabarrus, who is engaged to one of the most important men in the government, and who is also desired by Robespierre himself. When the young man disappears from her home, allegedly at the hands of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the ever-present Chauvelin enlists her help in trying to capture the elusive Pimpernel. Events lead to the Pimpernel’s wife being kidnapped, and once again the Pimpernel has to use all of his wits to escape Chauvelin’s clutches with his life, and wife, intact.</p>
			<p>As she has done throughout the series, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy">Baroness Orczy</a> weaves the Scarlet Pimpernel into the threads of the history of the Revolution. In this entry, it is the Pimpernel’s interactions with the leading players of the day that eventually leads to Robespierre’s downfall.</p>

Her recent marriage to the English baronet Sir Percy Blakeney has taken her away from the chaos in France to England, where she is quickly recognized as the most fashionable and clever lady in London. But even in England, she is unable to escape the effects of the Revolution, and she is soon blackmailed into a plot to unmask and capture the elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>
			<p>With <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy">Baroness Orczy</a> introduced the world to a talented, adventurous hero hiding behind a dull and ineffectual secret identity. Countless imitators followed, until the “secret identity” became a common feature of adventure stories.</p>
			<p>In addition to the novel, Orczy wrote with her husband a stage play of the same name, which broke stage records and saw several revivals. Both the play and the novel received much critical and popular acclaim, and Orczy went on to write several sequels about the mysterious Pimpernel and his companions.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the scene of Marat’s death, in an infamous cabaret in the old section of Paris, in an old abandoned château on the outskirts of the city, in a prison in the midst of the September massacres—the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League may be in all of these places, or they may be in none of them. In these eleven stories Chauvelin, Robespierre, and several other officials each make their attempts to catch the Pimpernel as he intervenes on the side of the innocent and helpless. The question in these stories is not really whether they will snare him, but how he will make his escape—and in some cases, whether he’s there at all.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man and his followers try again to overthrow the Stadtholder of the Netherlands.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Set a mere three months after <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy/the-laughing-cavalier"><i>The Laughing Cavalier</i></a>, the titular first Sir Percy is set to wed his love Gilda in a double wedding with her brother and his intended. The attendees include many of the rich and famous, including the Stadtholder himself. But immediately after the ceremony, bad news arrives, and Percy, <abbr class="initialism">A.K.A.</abbr> Diogenes, is tasked with rushing to get messages to two of the Stadtholder’s divisions that are in peril from the enemy. But there are unknown enemies about as well as known ones, and Diogenes will soon face the darkest hours and direst threats of his young life.</p>
			<p>In the seventh entry in the series, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy">Baroness Orczy</a> returns again to early seventeenth-century Netherlands, but with a darker tone than <i>The Laughing Cavalier</i>. This time she turns her focus to the antagonist and his henchmen, and once again puts her hero in an untenable position. This time the nation’s life is at stake, as well as his own.</p>

		<summary type="text">A famous journalist is drawn into the intrigues of two Eastern European nations in the aftermath of World War I.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Rosemary, the former love of Peter Blakeney, is about to be married to one of Peter’s friends. A famous journalist, she is asked to come to Transylvania and report on the Romanian occupation following the first World War, having travelled there many times in her childhood with Peter’s mother. She agrees to move up her wedding so that her fiancé can travel with her. Soon after they get there, Peter’s nephew and girlfriend are arrested for treason, and Rosemary is given a terrible choice—all while Peter arrives in the country as well, seemingly working against his own family.</p>
			<p>Just as she went back several generations in previous entries in the series, this time the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy">Baroness Orczy</a> goes forward several, to the years immediately following World War I. Having grown up in Hungary, she sets the story in an area of the world very familiar to her, weaving her fictional characters into the real-world history of the time.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman and her father are kidnapped by a man intent on revenge for his father’s death.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the midst of the French Revolution, Pierre, a young firebrand, convinces a group of rabble to rise up against the local duc. Coming across the carriage of the duc’s daughter on their march, Pierre assaults her, is run over by the carriage, and disappears. Looking to punish someone for the uprising, the duc has Pierre’s father hanged.</p>
			<p>Years later, Pierre has changed his name, gathered some wealth, and ingratiated himself with the duc (who does not know him). Pierre has plans to avenge his father’s death against both the duc and his daughter, and he has enlisted the aid of Chauvelin, the Scarlet Pimpernel’s avowed enemy.

		<summary type="text">A young woman pursues revenge against the man who killed her brother in a duel years before.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The young Vicomte de Marny rashly challenges a French official to a duel, and dies as a result. The Vicomte’s father, the ancient Duc de Marny, insists that his daughter, Juliette, swear an oath before God to seek revenge on the man who killed her brother. Years later, as the French Revolution rages, Juliette insinuates herself into the official’s household, and quickly discovers a way to anonymously accuse him before the National Convention. It will take all of the Scarlet Pimpernel’s ingenuity to rescue his friend from the guillotine.</p>
			<p><i>I Will Repay</i> is the first of the many sequels that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy">Baroness Orczy</a> wrote after the phenomenal success of the book and play versions of <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/baroness-orczy/the-scarlet-pimpernel">The Scarlet Pimpernel</a></i>. In this first sequel, she leaves him mostly in the background until the denouement, when the Pimpernel once more must use all of his skills in disguise and subterfuge to rescue a friend and his household.</p>

		<summary type="text">A brief overview of the goals and methods of the Positivist philosophical movement.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte">Auguste Comte</a>, considered by some to be the first “philosopher of science,” was perhaps most famous for founding the theory of Positivism: a framework of thinking and living meant to engender unity across humanity, backed by love, science, and intellect.</p>
			<p>Positivism itself is a combination philosophy and way of life. Here Comte lays down the various tenets of the philosophy, describing what he views as the six major characteristics of the system. Comte goes into surprising detail, going so far as to describe minutiae like how children should be educated, the structure of a unified global committee of nations, new flags, calendars, the role of the arts, and so on. He ends the book with what he calls the “Religion of Humanity,” a secular religion meant to replace the traditional religions that people of the time were becoming disillusioned with.</p>
			<p>The book and the theory are both very much products of the time. Comte was born around the end of the French Revolution, and lived in Paris during that time when republican ideas, respect for science, and a revolutionary and forward-thinking spirit made fertile ground for change. He viewed Positivism as the single solution to most of the problems of the day, including Communism, the plight of the working class, the shift away from traditional religion, and the constant war and strife that had plagued humanity.</p>
			<p>Comte’s theories gained a huge following: you might even recognize the Positivist motto, “Order and Progress,” inscribed on Brazil’s national flag. While Positivism and its executive arm, the Church of Humanity, today only seem to survive in any significant number in Brazil—and even there in a greatly declined state—its theories were hugely influential in the emergence of many “ethical societies” and secular church movements around the globe.</p>

		<summary type="text">A civil servant tired of bureaucracy quits his job to become a writer, and falls in with a group of artists and philosophers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/august-strindberg">August Strindberg’s</a> novel <i>The Red Room</i> centers on the civil servant Arvid Falk as he tries to find meaning in his life through the pursuit of writing. He’s accompanied by a crew of painters, sculptors and philosophers each on their own journey for the truth, who meet in the “Red Room” of a local restaurant.</p>
			<p>Drawing heavily on August’s own experiences, <i>The Red Room</i> was published in Sweden in 1879. Its reception was less than complimentary in Sweden—a major newspaper called it “dirt”—but it fared better in the rest of Scandinavia and soon was recognised in his home country. Since then it has been translated into multiple languages, including the 1913 English translation by Ellise Schleussner presented here.</p>

		<summary type="text">A writer succumbing to mania tries to find a path out through occultism and religion, in Strindberg’s semi-autobiographical novel.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The narrator of <i>The Inferno</i>—ostensibly <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/august-strindberg">August Strindberg</a> himself—has not had an easy recent past, and a move to Paris is not helping. As his mania overtakes his ability to function in the society of artists, writers, scientists and philosophers he’d like to be part of, he turns to more unconventional methods to help make sense of his world.</p>
			<p>Written in diary form, <i>The Inferno</i> is a semi-autobiographical work that blends self-deprecating humour with a whirl of neurosis and attempted rationalisation. The novel, with a certain amount of exaggeration for literary effect, charts two years of Strindberg’s life in the 1890s. Presented here is Claud Field’s 1913 translation from the original French.</p>

		<summary type="text">A gentleman remarries a woman of questionable character and tries to redeem her, but her past revisits the family in unexpected and tragic ways.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-w-pinero">Arthur Pinero</a> wrote <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i> in 1893 after penning several successful farces. Playing on the “woman with a past” plot that was popular in melodramas, Pinero steered it in a more serious direction, centering the play around the social consequences arising when Aubrey Tanqueray remarries in an attempt to redeem a woman with a questionable past.</p>
			<p>The play’s structure is based on the principles of the “well-made play” popular throughout the 19th-century. But just as Wilde manipulated the conventions of the “well-made play” to produce a new form of comedy, so did Arthur Pinero manipulate it, forgoing the happy ending to produce an elevated form of tragedy.</p>
			<p><i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i> was first performed in 1893, at the <abbr>St.</abbr> James Theatre, London, at a time when England was still resisting the growing movement in Europe towards realism and the portrayal of real social problems and human misconduct. But while it was regarded as shocking, it ran well and made a substantial profit. Theatre historian <abbr>J. P.</abbr> Wearing phrased it thus: “although not as avant-garde as Ibsen’s plays, Tanqueray confronted its fashionable <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man’s visions lead him into the life of an author.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>An ancient Roman hilltop fort proves an irresistible draw to Lucian Taylor, but what awaits at the top isn’t just a view of the surrounding Welsh landscape but a bacchal experience his young soul isn’t ready for. This experience sets his path as he attempts to transcribe his increasingly elaborate visions into the perfect book; the book that will actually mean something more than the banal novels he sees the publishing houses push out.</p>
			<p><i>The Hill of Dreams</i> is a semi-autobiographical work, with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-machen">Arthur Machen</a> following a similar physical journey to the novel: a childhood in rural Wales followed by attempts to become an author in London. Machen was inspired by a review of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/laurence-sterne/the-life-and-opinions-of-tristram-shandy-gentleman"><i>Tristram Shandy</i></a> that described it as “a picaresque of the mind,” and determined to write “a <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></a> of the soul.” The protagonist’s isolation from the rest of society certainly resonates with that description.</p>
			<p>Machen wrote this ten years earlier than its original 1907 publication, it having been turned down by the publishers of the time. While it was mostly ignored on its initial release, it has picked up admirers over the years and is now viewed as one of Machen’s most important works.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of nine short fiction works by influential supernatural and horror author Arthur Machen.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-machen">Arthur Machen</a> was a Welsh man of letters who wrote his most famous work in the late 1890s and early 1900s. While his body of work is wide, he’s perhaps best known for his supernaturally-flavored proto-horror short stories. <i>The Great God Pan</i>—perhaps his most famous work—along with “The Inmost Light” and <i>The White People</i> deeply influenced later writers like <abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft. Stephen King has gone so far as to call <i>The Great God Pan</i> “maybe the best [horror story] in the English language.”</p>
			<p>Besides his horror short stories, Machen also wrote a handful of post World War I supernatural shorts. One of these, “The Bowmen,” was published in a popular newspaper and was implied to be non-fiction, leading to the creation of the “Angels of Mons” urban legend. This collection includes several other World War I short stories published by Machen.</p>

			<p><i>The Valley of Fear</i> is the final novel in the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> series by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>. The story originally appeared over several issues of the monthly <i>Strand Magazine</i> in late 1914 before being published as a standalone work.

			<p>In the novel, Holmes and his assistant Watson are called to assist with an investigation into the murder of John Douglas, a man shot in his own home at point-blank range with a shotgun. As evidence is examined and witnesses within the house are questioned, Holmes uncovers holes in testimonies and a connection to a secret society that no one wishes to discuss.</p>

		<summary type="text">An analytical detective is consulted by a young woman who has received a strange communication regarding her long-missing father and a mysterious treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Sign of the Four</i>, initially titled just <i>The Sign of Four</i>, is the second of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Doyle’s</a> novels to feature the analytical detective <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and his faithful companion and chronicler <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson. The action takes place not long after the events in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/a-study-in-scarlet"><i>A Study in Scarlet</i></a>, the first Holmes novel, and that prior case is referred to frequently at the beginning of this one.</p>
			<p>Holmes is consulted by a young woman about a strange communication she has received. Ten years previously her father Captain Morstan went missing the night after returning from service in the Far East before his daughter could travel to meet him. He has never been seen or heard of ever since. But a few years after his disappearance, Miss Morstan was startled to receive a precious pearl in the mail, with no sender’s name or address and no accompanying message. A similar pearl has arrived each subsequent year. Finally, she received an anonymous letter begging her to come to a meeting outside a London theater that very evening. She may bring two companions. Naturally, Holmes and Watson accompany the young woman to the mysterious meeting, and are subsequently involved in the unveiling of a complex story of treasure and betrayal.</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s first consulting detective returns to London after having faked his death some years before, and investigates a series of baffling mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> is the third collection of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Holmes</a> stories by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, published in 1905. It includes stories published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> in 1903 and 1904, bringing Holmes for the first time into the twentieth century.</p>
			<p>Doyle had memorably “killed off” Holmes in a struggle with his nemesis Professor Moriarty in the story “The Final Problem,” which had appeared in 1893 (and which is included in the collection <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-memoirs-of-sherlock-holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</a></i>). Intense public demand for more Holmes material after that had led to Doyle writing the novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-hound-of-the-baskervilles">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a></i>, and then finally to return to writing Holmes short stories once more. The first story in this collection, “The Adventure of the Empty House” finds <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson united once again with his old friend Sherlock Holmes, who explains how and why he faked his death at Reichenbach Falls.</p>
			<p>Apart from the leading story which “resurrects” Holmes, this collection contains a number of the best-known Holmes stories. “The Adventure of the Dancing Men” has Holmes deciphering a cryptogram to solve a mystery; encountering a callous blackmailer in “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton;” working out why cheap busts of Napoleon are being shattered all over London; and possibly averting a major European war in “The Adventure of the Second Stain.”</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s first consulting detective and his companion investigate further crimes and mysteries, culminating in a life-or-death struggle with an evil nemesis.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>, published in 1894, is the second collection of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories published in book form. All of the stories included in the collection previously appeared in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> between 1892 and 1893. They purport to be the accounts given by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson of the more remarkable cases in which his friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sherlock Holmes becomes involved in his role as a consulting detective.</p>
			<p>This collection has several memorable features. The first British edition omitted the story “The Adventure of the Cardboard Box” which appeared in <i>The Strand</i> in 1893. This story did appear in the very first American edition of the collection, immediately following “Silver Blaze,” but it was quickly replaced by a revised edition which omitted it. Apparently these omissions were at the specific request of the author, who was concerned that its inclusion of the theme of adultery would make it unsuitable for younger readers. The story was, however, eventually included in the later collection <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/his-last-bow"><i>His Last Bow</i></a>, but it is out of chronological position there. In this Standard Ebooks edition (as in most modern British editions), we have included this story to restore it to its correct chronological place in the Holmes canon.</p>
			<p><i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> is also notable because by this time <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Doyle</a> had tired of the Holmes character and decided to kill him off, so that this was intended to be the last Holmes collection ever to be published. It contains several of the best-known Holmes stories, including “Silver Blaze,” “The Musgrave Ritual,” and “The Greek Interpreter,” which introduces Sherlock’s brother Mycroft; and of course “The Final Problem” in which Holmes struggles with his nemesis Professor Moriarty.</p>

		<summary type="text">A team of scientists and adventurers explores a prehistoric land.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Even though <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Doyle</a> is most famous for his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock</a> stories, he was also a prolific novelist, and <i>The Lost World</i> is one of his more famous non-Sherlock novels. Like many novels of the day, it was first published serially.</p>
			<p>In it we meet a group of adventurers who head to a deep South American jungle to explore rumors of long-lost dinosaurs. The plot is driven by their journey, discoveries, and subsequent narrow escape. Notably, <i>The Lost World</i> is the novel in which Doyle’s popular recurring character, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/professor-challenger">Professor Challenger</a>, is introduced.</p>
			<p>Doyle based many of the characters and locations on people and places he was familiar with: the journalist Ed Malone was modeled on <abbr>E. D.</abbr> Morel, and Lord John Roxton on Roger Casement; the Lost World itself was based on descriptions of Bolivia in letters sent to Doyle by his friend Percy Harrison Fawcett.</p>
			<p>The novel remains hugely influential and widely adapted today. The title might even remind modern readers of a certain very famous movie franchise about dinosaur theme parks!</p>

		<summary type="text">A famous detective investigates a mysterious and apparently supernatural threat to the heir of a wealthy Dartmoor estate.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>It would be hard to nominate a more well-known character in English literature than that of the austere analytical detective <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, created by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> in the late 1880s. Holmes, alongside his friend and biographer <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson, appeared in two initial novels and dozens of short stories serialized in popular magazines, attracting a devoted, almost fanatical following which continues to this day.</p>
			<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, serialized in 1901–1902, was the third novel featuring Holmes and Watson. Sherlock Holmes is consulted in his Baker Street apartment by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mortimer, a physician now living on the fringes of Dartmoor. He gives Holmes and Watson an account of a centuries-old legend, in which a hell-hound slaughtered the debauched heir of the Baskerville family who had been in lecherous pursuit of an innocent maiden across the moor. The same hound is reputed to have harrowed several of the subsequent heirs to the estate.</p>
			<p>This ancient story might be dismissed as mere fancy, but for the fact that the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville recently died in very mysterious circumstances, apparently fleeing in terror from something which came from the moor. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mortimer is concerned that the new heir, Sir Henry, just returned from Canada, may be at risk from this supernatural beast. Holmes is intrigued, but being too busy to go himself, sends <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson to accompany Sir Henry to the ancestral home on Dartmoor and to report anything suspicious.</p>
			<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> is arguably the best, and certainly the most popular, of Doyle’s novels featuring his iconic detective. It has been translated into almost every language in the world and been the basis of dozens of movies (starting as early as 1914), radio plays and comic books.</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s first consulting detective investigates a variety of intriguing cases in the first Holmes short story collection.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> was the first collection of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> short stories <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Conan Doyle</a> published in book form, following the popular success of the novels <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/a-study-in-scarlet"><i>A Study in Scarlet</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-sign-of-the-four"><i>The Sign of the Four</i></a>, which introduced the characters of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson and the austere analytical detective Sherlock Holmes.</p>
			<p>The collection contains twelve stories, all originally published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> between July 1891 and June 1892. Narrated by the first-person voice of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson, they involve him and Holmes solving a series of mysterious cases.</p>
			<p>Some of the more well-known stories in this collection are “A Scandal in Bohemia,” in which Holmes comes up against a worthy opponent in the form of Irene Adler, whom Holmes forever after admiringly refers to as <em>the</em> woman; “The Redheaded League,” involving a bizarre scheme offering a well-paid sinecure to redheaded men; and “The Speckled Band,” in which Holmes and Watson save a young woman from a terrible death.</p>

			<p><i>His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes</i> is the fourth collection of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories published by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyles</a>. It begins with a preface by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson, supposedly written in 1917, assuring the reader that Holmes is still alive but living in quiet retirement in Sussex.</p>
			<p>This collection contains the well-known stories “The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans,” in which Holmes has to track down stolen plans for a new kind of submarine; and “The Adventure of the Devil’s Foot” in which a Cornish family is found one morning driven mad or dead, with expressions of horror on their faces. The titular story “His Last Bow” is set on the very eve of the outbreak of the First World War, and involves Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to defeat a German spy.</p>

		<summary type="text">The self-declared world’s first consulting detective unravels a mysterious case of murder and revenge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Study in Scarlet</i> is the novel which first introduced <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyles’</a> iconic characters Sherlock Holmes and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson. It was published in 1887 in a popular magazine, <i>Beeton’s Christmas Annual</i>. It attracted little public attention at the time, but interest in Holmes continued to build with the subsequent series of short stories Doyle wrote featuring the austere, analytical detective—now one of the most well-known characters in all of English literature.</p>
			<p><i>A Study in Scarlet</i> is told from the point of view of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson, a medical doctor who has recently returned to London after suffering serious injury and illness as part of the Army Medical Department deployed to Afghanistan. In precarious health and even more precarious financial straits, he’s looking for cheap lodgings when a friend introduces him to Sherlock Holmes. The pair agree to share the rent of a flat Holmes has found.</p>
			<p>Watson is baffled by his companion’s strange nature, his peculiar interests, his unusual breadth of knowledge in certain fields alongside his shocking ignorance in others, and his many strange visitors. Only eventually does Watsonb discover that Holmes has set himself up as the world’s first “consulting detective,” and it’s not long before Watson finds himself assisting Holmes in a mysterious case. The body of a man has been found in an abandoned house, without wounds or other marks of injury. But on the wall, scrawled in blood, is the word RACHE. The subsequent unravelling of the mystery takes many unexpected turns.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two sisters growing up in an 1860s industrial town in Middle England find their lives taking very different, and dramatic, turns.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Old Wives’ Tale</i>, considered to be one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arnold-bennett">Bennett’s</a> finest works, begins in the 1860s, in the industrial “Five Towns” of the English Midlands, where he set many of his partially-autobiographical stories.</p>
			<p>The novel follows the prosperous Baines family, who live above the successful clothing shop they own in the town of Bursley (based on Burslem, in Staffordshire). Even when the two Baines daughters were still young, their characters are already formed. Sophia has “youth, beauty, and rank in her favour,” while Constance is “foolishly good-natured,” with benevolence that is “eternally rising up and overpowering her reason.”</p>
			<p>Their paths diverge quickly. While still in her teens, the headstrong Sophia elopes with a traveling salesman, leaving England’s provinces for Paris. Constance, who later marries the head employee at the store, hardly ever leaves their town—or even the square where their shop is located. As the novelist <abbr>J. B.</abbr> Priestley observed, this gently ironic and sprawling novel sets its “two suffering heroines” against “three conquering heroes, Time, Mutability, and Death.”</p>

		<summary type="text">An American millionaire’s spur-of-the-moment purchase of a hotel leads to the uncovering of a secret plot.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Theodore Racksole—one of the richest men in America, and consequently the world—sits down in London’s Grand Babylon Hotel and orders a beefsteak and a bottle of beer, he isn’t aware that he’s about to become part of a plot involving blackmail, espionage, murder, the royal families of Europe and his daughter Nella. As he’s sucked in to the inner workings of the hotel and its staff he has to make a series of stark choices for the safety of his family and guests.</p>
			<p><i>The Grand Babylon Hotel</i> proceeds at a pace that betrays the novel’s roots: it was originally serialized in 1901 in the <i>Golden Penny</i>. It was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arnold-bennett">Arnold Bennett’s</a> second novel, and was followed by at least forty works of fiction along with numerous plays and non-fiction works. Since its original publication <i>The Grand Babylon Hotel</i> has remained in print, and it has also been adapted for film and radio.</p>

		<summary type="text">A London bookseller’s “grand passion” for hoarding money threatens his own happiness as well as those closest to him.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Riceyman Steps</i>, first published in 1923, is set in “dingy and sordid” Clerkenwell, in central London, where “existence was a dangerous and difficult adventure in almost frantic quest of food, drink and shelter.” It’s there that Henry Earlforward runs a gloomy, dusty store full of secondhand books. He eats less and less with every day, keeps his young servant Elsie working long hours for minimal pay, and never lights a candle when darkness will do. One day he takes notice of Violet, a middle-aged widow who owns a confectionary shop nearby, and they become husband and wife soon after.</p>
			<p>It quickly becomes clear that his miserliness, his “grand passion and vice,” has rubbed off on Violet, threatening her chances at happiness just as much as his. His obsession also imperils Elsie’s ability to help her lover Joe, who returned from World War I with shell shock, and who desperately needs her.</p>
			<p>The year it was published <i>Riceyman Steps</i> won the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction</a>. Its tragic tone represents a departure from many of the novels and stories <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arnold-bennett">Arnold Bennett</a> set in the “Five Towns,” the fictional location inspired by his Staffordshire childhood. Instead, it reflects the pain and disappointment of the years immediately following the Great War. As Earlforward tells a customer early on, “We’re not quite straight here yet. The truth is, we haven’t been straight since 1914.”</p>

		<summary type="text">Aristotle examines how one may live in the most thriving, excellent manner.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aristotle">Aristotle</a> examines how best to live by looking at the nature of those virtues that characterize the most thriving human beings, and then at how to acquire and develop such virtues. This book is considered the founding document of what is now known as the “virtue ethics” tradition.</p>
			<p>Along the way, Aristotle delves into pleasure, happiness, justice, friendship, and willpower. He intended the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> to be the foundation on which to build his <i>Politics</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> is based on Aristotle’s lectures at the Lyceum and was originally collected as a series of ten scrolls. In translation it was hugely influential in the development of Western philosophic tradition, quickly becoming one of the core works of medieval philosophy.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three sisters long to escape their provincial town and return to Moscow.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The sisters Olga, Masha, and Irina live with their brother Andrey in a provincial Russian town, and plan to return to Moscow, where they grew up, as soon as they’re able. Olga doesn’t want to continue working at the school where she’s a teacher and occasional headmaster; Masha is disillusioned in her marriage; Irina hopes to find her true love; and Andrey shows promise of becoming a professor. Also stationed in their town is a battery of soldiers that provide them with a social life. When Andrey falls in love with Natasha, their hopes for change are dashed, bit by bit.</p>
			<p>First performed in 1901 at the Moscow Art Theatre, <i>Three Sisters</i> is considered one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov’s</a> best plays. While critical reception at the time was mixed, the show was popular enough to become a part of the company’s repertoire, and is still commonly staged and adapted today.</p>

		<summary type="text">Von Koren, an educated zoologist, finds the slovenly lifestyle of Laevsky, a drinker, to be worthless. Finally, Laevsky can’t take it any more.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Duel</i> is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov’s</a> longest works, skirting the edge between novel and novella. Like many of Chekhov’s works, it was first published as a serial.</p>
			<p>Laevsky is a womanizing drunkard, a slave to life’s vices. His wantonness clashes with the moralistic zoologist Von Koren, who grows to despise Laevsky. Their mutual enmity culminates in a duel—though neither they, nor their friends, really want it to happen.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Chekhov’s short stories and novellas ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a> is widely considered to be one of the greatest short story writers in history. A physician by day, he’s famously quoted as saying, “Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my mistress.” Chekhov wrote nearly 300 short stories in his long writing career; while at first he wrote mainly to make a profit, as his interest in writing—and his skill—grew, he wrote stories that heavily influenced the modern development of the form.</p>
			<p>His stories are famous for, among other things, their ambiguous morality and their often inconclusive nature. Chekhov was a firm believer that the role of the artist was to correctly pose a question, but not necessarily to answer it.</p>
			<p>This collection contains all of his short stories and two novellas, all translated by Constance Garnett, and arranged by the date they were originally published.</p>

		<summary type="text">The rise of a business magnate with a suspicious background creates ripples among society and affects the fortunes of several young men and women in London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Way We Live Now</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Anthony Trollope’s</a> longest novel, published in two volumes in 1875 after first appearing in serial form.</p>
			<p>After an extended visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1872, Trollope was outraged on his return to England by a number of financial scandals, and was determined to expose the dishonesty, corruption, and greed they embodied. <i>The Way We Live Now</i> centers around a foreign businessman, Augustus Melmotte, who has come to prominence in London despite rumors about his past dealings on the Continent. He is immensely rich, and his daughter Marie is considered to be a desirable catch for several aristocratic young men in search of a fortune. Melmotte gains substantial influence because of his wealth. He rises in society and is even put up as a candidate for Parliament, despite a general feeling that he must be a fraudster and liar. A variety of sub-plots are woven around this central idea.</p>
			<p><i>The Way We Live Now</i> is generally considered to be one of Trollope’s best novels and is often included in lists of the best novels written in English.</p>

		<summary type="text">In a cathedral town in England, a minor cleric becomes involved in a dispute about the wardenship of a hospital for superannuated wool-carders, and suffers pangs of conscience.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Warden</i> is concerned with the unassuming <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Septimus Harding, who has for many years been the Warden of Hiram’s Hospital in the fictional town of Barchester. This “hospital” is what we would today probably call an aged-care or retirement home. It was established under the provisions of a will to look after the needs of old men too feeble to work any longer and unable to support themselves. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harding benefits financially from his position, though the duties are very slight.</p>
			<p>A local doctor, though sweet on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harding’s daughter Eleanor, is nevertheless a keen reformer, zealous to overturn what he sees as corrupt patronage in the Church. He investigates the terms of Hiram’s will and concludes that the money intended for the benefit of the aged wool-carders is unfairly being consumed by the salary of the Warden. He proceeds to pursue this issue through the pages of a crusading journal, <i>The Jupiter</i>.</p>
			<p>Though strongly defended by the Church authorities, including his son-in-law Archdeacon Grantly, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harding has long struggles with his conscience because of this imputation.</p>
			<p><i>The Warden</i>, published in 1855, was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Trollope’s</a> first major writing success, and formed the basis for a series of six novels set in the same fictional county and its cathedral city of Barchester, now known as the “Chronicles of Barsetshire.”</p>

		<summary type="text">An innocent young woman agrees to marry a socialite but is devastated when he opts to break his commitment and marry the daughter of an Earl.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Small House at Allington</i> was originally serialized in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> between July and December 1862. It is the fifth book in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Trollope’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/chronicles-of-barsetshire">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a> series, being largely set in that fictious county of England. It includes a few of the characters from the earlier books, though largely in very minor roles. It could also be said to be the first of Trollope’s Palliser series, as it introduces Plantagenet Palliser as the heir to the Duke of Omnium.</p>
			<p>The major story, however, relates to the inhabitants of the Small House at the manor of Allington. The Small House was once the Dower House of the estate (a household where the widowed mother of the squire might live, away from the Great House). Now living there, however, is Mary Dale, the widow of the squire’s brother, and her two daughters, Isabella (Bell) and Lilian (Lily). The main focus of the novel is on Lily Dale, who is courted by Adolphus Crosbie, a friend of the squire’s nephew. In a matter of a few weeks, Lily falls deeply in love with Crosbie, who quickly proposes to her and is accepted. A few weeks later, however, Crosbie is visiting Courcy Castle and decides an alliance with the Earl’s daughter Alexandrina would be far preferable from a social and monetary point of view. Without speaking to Lily, he abruptly changes his plans and asks Alexandrina to marry him instead. This act of betrayal is devastating to Lily and her family.</p>
			<p>This novel, along with the other titles in the Barsetshire series, was turned into a radio play for Radio 4 in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s. The British Prime Minister John Major was recorded in the 1990s as saying that <i>The Small House at Allington</i> was his favorite book.</p>

		<summary type="text">An impoverished clergyman is accused of theft, and this disgrace leads to great suffering for both his family and those that love them.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Last Chronicle of Barset</i> is the sixth, and as its title would suggest, final novel in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Anthony Trollope’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/chronicles-of-barsetshire">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a>. Like the earlier books, it was serialized in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, with a hardcover edition coming out in 1867. It brings together many of the characters who had appeared in series’ earlier novels, and rounds off a number of story threads that those novels began.</p>
			<p>The primary storyline is concerned with the Reverend Josiah Crawley, who, as the book opens, has been accused of passing a check for twenty pounds, a check not made out to himself and whose possession he cannot account for. The accusation has significant implications for many of the other characters.</p>
			<p><i>The Last Chronicle of Barset</i> was made into a television series released by the BBC in 1959. Along with the other novels in the series, it was made into a radio play released by Radio 4 in the United Kingdom in the 1990s.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young vicar with an aristocratic patron foolishly becomes mired in debt.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Framley Parsonage</i> is the fourth novel in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Trollope’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/chronicles-of-barsetshire">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a> series. Originally a serial, it was first published as a book in 1861, and it has since been praised for its unsentimental depiction of the lives of middle-class people in the mid-Victorian era.</p>
			<p>As with the other books in the series, <i>Framley Parsonage</i> is set in the fictious English county of Barsetshire, and deals with the doings of a variety of families and characters who live in the region, several of whom have appeared in the previous books; but it primarily concerns the young Reverend Mark Robarts.</p>
			<p>Robarts has been appointed as vicar of the parish of Framley through the patronage of Lady Lufton of Framley Court, the mother of his long-time friend Ludovic, now Lord Lufton. After he and his wife Fanny take up residence in Framley Parsonage, Robarts is led into the society of some loose-living aristocrats through his friendship with Ludovic. Robarts eventually finds himself weakly consenting to his name being included on a bill for a loan to one of his new connections, Sowerby. By so doing, he becomes liable for debts he cannot possibly satisfy.</p>
			<p>An important secondary thread involves Mark Robarts’ sister Lucy, who after their father’s death comes to live with her brother’s family at the parsonage. Through them, she becomes acquainted with Lady Lufton and her son Ludovic, and romantic complications ensue.</p>
			<p><i>Framley Parsonage</i> was originally published anonymously in serial form in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, and such was its popularity that during its publication a hysterical young woman apparently tried to gain notoriety in her country town by claiming to be its author. “The real writer,” we are told, “dealt very gently with the pretender.”</p>

			<p><i>Doctor Thorne</i> is the third book in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Trollope’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/chronicles-of-barsetshire">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a> series, which is set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, somewhere in England’s West Country. Unlike the two earlier novels in the series, <i>Doctor Thorne</i> isn’t set in the cathedral city of Barchester, but in the small village of Greshamsbury and the estate of the local squire, Greshamsbury Park.</p>
			<p>Doctor Thorne is a middle-aged medical practitioner in Greshamsbury, a friend of the local squire Mr. Gresham, who is deeply in debt because of ill-advised attempts to gain a seat in Parliament. Doctor Thorne not only provides medical advice to the Greshams, but also assists Mr. Gresham in obtaining financial loans from a local self-made entrepreneur, Sir Richard Scratcherd. When Mr. Gresham’s son Frank comes of age, it is impressed on the young man that he must “marry money” to overcome the debts of the estate.</p>
			<p><i>Doctor Thorne</i> is regarded highly among Trollope’s works, with one prominent critic, Michael Sadleir, writing in 1927 of “the sensational perfection of <i>Doctor Thorne</i>.”</p>
			<p>A television adaptation of the book was produced by ITV and aired in March 2016, with a script written by Julian Fellowes, the writer of <i>Gosford Park</i> and <i>Downton Abbey</i></p>

		<summary type="text">The affections of a young widow are at play while rival clerical factions contend for control over church matters in the cathedral city of Barchester.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Barchester Towers</i>, published in 1857, is the sequel to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope">Trollope’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope/the-warden"><i>The Warden</i></a> and continues the story of the clerical doings in the fictional cathedral town of Barchester.</p>
			<p>As this novel opens, the old Bishop of Barchester lies dying, and there is considerable doubt as to who will replace him. The Bishop’s son <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Grantly, the Archdeacon, has high hopes of succeeding him, but these hopes are dashed and a new Bishop, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Proudie, is appointed. Along with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Proudie comes his domineering wife and their ambitious chaplain the Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Slope.</p>
			<p>The old clerical party headed by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Grantly and the new, championed by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Proudie and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Slope, are soon in contention over Church matters. These two parties represent a then-significant struggle between different evangelical approaches in the Church of England. One local issue in particular is fought over—the appointment of a new Warden for Hiram’s Hospital, the focus of the preceding book.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Eleanor Bold is the daughter of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harding, the prior Warden. She has recently been widowed. The wealth she inherited from her late husband makes her an attractive match, and her affections are in contention from several prospective suitors, including the oily <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Slope. All of this lends itself to considerable humor and interest.</p>
			<p>Though not well received by critics on its initial publication, <i>Barchester Towers</i> is now regarded as one of Trollope’s most popular novels. Together with <i>The Warden</i>, it was made into a very successful television series by the BBC in 1982.</p>

		<summary type="text">King Rudolph V of Ruritania is drugged and abducted on the eve of his coronation, and a gentleman on holiday who happens to look like the king has to stop the sinister plot.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-hope">Anthony Hope</a> is an adventure novel first published in 1894 that takes place in the fictional Kingdom of Ruritania.</p>
			<p>It tells the story of Rudolph Rassendyll, who is, because of past indiscretions in the family and unbeknownst to him, the near twin of King Rudolph V of Ruritania. Labeled a ne’er-do-well by his sister-in-law, young Rudolph determines to escape his family and secretly travel to Ruritania for the coronation of his distant relative. But when the king is drugged and abducted on the eve of this ceremony, young Rassendyll is convinced to take his place to try and save the day.</p>
			<p>But things don’t go as planned as the conspirators fail to reckon with the king’s brother, the dastardly Duke of Strelsau or his fiancée, the beautiful Princess Flavia. What follows is a tale of bravery, sacrifice and love, filled with romance and feats of derring-do that still stands the test of time.</p>
			<p><i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> was Hope’s most famous novel and achieved instant success. Such was the impact of this novel that the setting of Ruritania became famous in its own right as the generic term referring to romantic stories set in fictional central European countries. It went on to spawn numerous adaptations, retellings and homages. Anthony Hope wrote a sequel in 1898 called <i>Rupert of Hentzau</i> but it never achieved the success of the original.</p>

		<summary type="text">The epic poem that follows the legendary hero Siegfried on his adventures, his death, and his wife’s revenge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Nibelungenlied</i> was Germany’s first heroic epic put into writing. Thomas Carlyle considered it “a precious national possession, recovered after six centuries of neglect, [which] takes undisputed place among the sacred books of German literature.” Due to a lack of interest in copying the manuscripts, the work was forgotten, only faintly remembered as an influence in other German writing. Today, a total of 36 manuscripts have been unearthed. Many of these are only poem fragments, but three manuscripts have been viewed as the most complete and authentic versions to exist: these manuscripts are referred to as “A,” “B,” and “C.”</p>
			<p>“A” follows most of the original written forms, but is the shortest manuscript of the three. “C” is the most altered edition, as it was changed to suit later cultural tastes. Manuscript “B” is considered the gold standard since it shows signs of minimal alterations and is of intermediate length. Alice Horton has used manuscript “B” as the foundation of her English edition, creating a work that is accurate in translation and with its lyrical quality preserved. It portrays an epic adventure that grabs and holds the reader’s attention.</p>
			<p>Siegfried, the knighted prince of Netherland, has plans to marry the beautiful Princess Kriemhilda of Burgundy. He visits Worms to bargain with the three kings and Kriemhilda’s brothers: Gunther, Gernot, and Giselher. Famed for his impenetrable skin and inhuman strength after bathing in dragon’s blood, Siegfried may be the perfect man to help them. To marry their sister and receive her wealth, Siegfried must convince the ruler beyond the sea and the mighty maiden warrior to be Gunther’s wife. This queen has sworn only to marry a man who can beat her three challenges, at the risk of beheading if he should fail.</p>

		<summary type="text">A hero is hired to kill a monster that has been plaguing the land.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Horothgar, King of the Danes, invites warriors from neighboring kingdoms to his great mead hall with the hope that one of them will solve his problem. A monster named Grendel has been terrorizing the land and killing his people. One of the warriors who answers this call is our epic hero, Beowulf.</p>
			<p>The <i>Beowulf</i> Manuscript, also known as the Nowell Codex, dates back to the late 10th century or early 11th century and is the only copy in existence. In 1731, the manuscript was damaged from the Cotton Library fire, making several lines in the poem unreadable. Today, with the help of modern technology, advanced techniques are being used not only to preserve the document from further degradation but also to reveal missing letters. All this is done to ensure that this epic story will continue to live on for many more generations.</p>

		<summary type="text">When a mysterious young widow arrives in a small rural area, gossip blackens her name before her true story is eventually discovered by a male admirer.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> was the second novel written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anne-bronte">Anne Brontë</a>, the youngest of the Brontë sisters.</p>
			<p>The novel begins with the arrival of a young widow, Mrs. Graham, in a rural neighborhood. She brings with her her five year old son Arthur and takes up residence in the partly-ruined Wildfell Hall. Gossip soon begins to swirl around her, questioning her mysterious background and the closeness of her relationship with her landlord.</p>
			<p>First released in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell, <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> was considered shocking by the standards of the time due to its themes of domestic disharmony, drunkenness and adultery. Perhaps this was why it quickly became a publishing success. However, when Anne died from tuberculosis her sister Charlotte prevented its republication until 1854, perhaps fearing for her sister’s reputation, though some attributed her actions to jealousy.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two beautiful sisters are forced to live under the control of their tyrannical nobleman father.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Sicilian Romance</i> begins when a tourist meets a local monk at the crumbling ruins of the castle Mazzini. The monk invites her to the monastery to view a manuscript that records the mysterious happenings that occurred hundreds of years ago in the once-great castle. The manuscript tells of the plight of two sisters, Julia and Emilia Mazzini, who, after the return of their tyrannical father, witness supernatural phenomena around the castle’s neglected southern wing.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ann-radcliffe">Radcliffe</a> was viewed as the greatest writer of the Gothic literary style by most early 19th century critics and literary historians despite <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/horace-walpole">Horace Walpole</a> seemingly “inventing” the genre in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/horace-walpole/the-castle-of-otranto"><i>The Castle of Otranto</i></a>. <i>A Sicilian Romance</i> was first published anonymously in 1790, making it the second of her published works.</p>

		<summary type="text">The comic diary of a young woman recounting her escapades and romances in 1920s New York and Europe.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>It’s the roaring 20s, and a young flapper named Lorelei decides to keep a diary after receiving a blank journal from a “gentleman friend.” She has an apartment in New York paid for by a Chicago businessman named Gus Eisman; when he’s in town, Mr. Eisman spends his time “educating” Lorelei by going out to dinner, taking in shows, and then escorting her to her apartment to “talk about the topics of the day until quite late.” When he’s away, Lorelei does much the same with the other men she has charmed.</p>
			<p>Joined by her best friend Dorothy, Lorelei embarks on a cruise to Europe in order to meet Mr. Eisman in Paris and continue her education. As the diary unfolds, we learn more about Lorelei’s past and her cynical, rather mercenary approach towards romance, all set in a light, funny, and very charming atmosphere.</p>
			<p>Originally published as a series of sketches known as “the Lorelei stories” in <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>, <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> was published as a novel in 1925. Despite lukewarm initial reviews, it quickly became a success, becoming the second-best seller of 1926. Since then it has gone on to be an international bestseller, having been printed in over eighty-five editions and adapted several times—most famously as the 1953 film starring Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton">Edith Wharton</a> called it “the great American novel,” and it has garnered praise from many authors including <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">James Joyce</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A schoolgirl navigates a difficult year after a new girl has inadvertently assumed her mantle.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ingred Saxon grew up in luxury in Rotherwood, a large house in southern England, and is looking forwards to moving back in after its wartime usage as a Red Cross hospital. Unfortunately for her, her family is weathering unforeseen financial troubles, and has had to let it out to a different family while they cram into their dramatically smaller bungalow. Even more unfortunately, the popular new girl at Grovebury College is the new tenant, leaving Ingred to remake previous bonds she’d taken for granted.</p>
			<p><i>A Popular Schoolgirl</i> is just one of nearly fifty “schoolgirl fiction” books written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/angela-brazil">Angela Brazil</a>, and put together they sold over three million copies. As a boarder at a girls’ school herself in her youth, she successfully mined this rich seam of experience to the tune of two novels and several short stories a year. Her protagonists are ultimately believable young women, written in a way that exposes their hopes and fears at a time where possibilities for women were rapidly opening up.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A brutal force of insectoid aliens called Throgs effortlessly destroy a Terran survey camp on Warlock, a planet seemingly devoid of intelligent life that both Throgs and Terrans hope to colonize. Two Terrans who survive the enemy attack must go on the run, weaponless and with only a pair of wolverines as their companions. These survivors are driven to an unknown destination by dreams so powerful that they may be visions; but as they get closer to their goal, crossing brutal landscapes, tumultuous seas, and fog-filled caverns, the two find themselves losing control over their actions and unsure of what is real in this strange and hostile world.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two human protagonists find themselves on opposite sides of an inter-species war.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>This sequel to <i>The Stars Are Ours!</i> was first published in 1957 by the World Publishing Company. It continues the tale of the humans who escaped an anti-intellectual Earth and founded a colony on Astra, a planet across the galaxy. Astra has a vibrant, intelligent species, as well as the ruins of a much older civilization.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/andre-norton">Norton</a> weaves two stories together by alternating points of view with each chapter. We follow a 4th generation colonist, as well as a mechanic-pilot newly arrived on Astra as a member of a research mission from a recently revived Earth.</p>
			<p>Each is on a journey of discovery, and they find themselves allied with opposing sides of an ongoing war between two intelligent, indigenous species.</p>

		<summary type="text">A witty, sharp collection of sardonic word definitions from the 1800s and early 1900s that provide a snapshot into the irreverent humor of early American culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“<b>Dictionary</b><em>, n</em>: A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.”</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ambrose-bierce">Bierce’s</a> groundbreaking <i>Devil’s Dictionary</i> had a complex publication history. Started in the mid-1800s as an irregular column in Californian newspapers under various titles, he gradually refined the new-at-the-time idea of an irreverent set of glossary-like definitions. The final name, as we see it titled in this work, did not appear until an 1881 column published in the periodical <i>The San Francisco Illustrated Wasp</i>.</p>
			<p>There were no publications of the complete glossary in the 1800s. Not until 1906 did a portion of Bierce’s collection get published by Doubleday, under the name <i>The Cynic’s Word Book</i>—the publisher not wanting to use the word “Devil” in the title, to the great disappointment of the author. The 1906 word book only went from A to L, however, and the remainder was never released under the compromised title.</p>
			<p>In 1911 the <i>Devil’s Dictionary</i> as we know it was published in complete form as part of Bierce’s collected works (volume 7 of 12), including the remainder of the definitions from M to Z. It has been republished a number of times, including more recent efforts where older definitions from his columns that never made it into the original book were included. Due to the complex nature of copyright, some of those found definitions have unclear public domain status and were not included. This edition of the book includes, however, a set of definitions attributed to his one-and-only “Demon’s Dictionary” column, including Bierce’s classic definition of A: “the first letter in every properly constructed alphabet.”</p>
			<p>Bierce enjoyed “quoting” his pseudonyms in his work. Most of the poetry, dramatic scenes and stories in this book attributed to others were self-authored and do not exist outside of this work. This includes the prolific <em>Father Gassalasca Jape</em>, whom he thanks in the preface—“jape” of course having the definition: “a practical joke.”</p>
			<p>This book is a product of its time and must be approached as such. Many of the definitions hold up well today, but some might be considered less palatable by modern readers. Regardless, the book’s humorous style is a valuable snapshot of American culture from past centuries.</p>

		<summary type="text">Twelve poems detailing the adventures of Arthur’s round table.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Idylls</i> are a series of twelve long blank verse poems by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alfred-lord-tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, telling the tale of Arthur and his round table. While some of them are stories of adventure and daring of the kind you’d expect from an Arthurian epic, many take on a darker tone, relating how Arthur was betrayed and how his kingdom grew decadent and eventually fell.</p>
			<p>The poems stand on their own as carefully-constructed and masterful examples of long-form blank-verse poetry, and they’re engaging to read strictly as tales of knighthood and intrigue—but many also read the <i>Idylls</i> as allegorical references to Victorian societal mores.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young Gascon moves to Paris to join the King’s Musketeers where he starts to investigate the kidnapping of his landlord’s wife.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Three Musketeers</i> is the first of three adventure novels written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a> featuring the character of d’Artagnan.</p>
			<p>The young d’Artagnan leaves home in Gascony for Paris to join the King’s Musketeers. On his way to Paris, the letter which will introduce him to the commander of the Musketeers is stolen by a mysterious man in the town of Meung. This “Man of Meung” turns out to be a confidant of the infamous Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of the government of France.</p>
			<p>When he arrives in Paris and seeks an audience with the commander of the Musketeers, d’Artagnan sees this man again and rushes to confront him. As he pushes his way out he provokes three inseparable musketeers—Athos, Porthos and Aramis—and ends up setting up duels with all three of them that afternoon. At the first of the duels he discovers, to his surprise, that each of the three is a second to the other. As they start to fight, they are ambushed by the Cardinal’s men and join forces. So begins one of the most enduring partnerships in literature.</p>
			<p>When d’Artagnan’s landlord tells him that his wife has been kidnapped, d’Artagnan investigates, falls in love and becomes embroiled in a plot to destabilize France.</p>
			<p><i>The Three Musketeers</i> was first published in 1844 and has been adapted for stage, film, television, and animation many times; such is the endurance of its appeal. At its heart is a fast-paced tale of love and adventure.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man seeks revenge for having been falsely imprisoned years earlier.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Edmond Dantès is a young man about to be made captain of a cargo vessel and marry his sweetheart. But he is arrested at his pre-wedding feast, having been falsely accused of being a Bonapartist. Thrown into the notorious Château d’If prison, he eventually meets an ancient inmate who teaches him language, science, and passes hints of a hidden fortune. When Edmond makes his way out of prison, he plots to reward those who stood by him (his old employer, for one), and to seek revenge on the men who betrayed him: one who wrote the letter that denounced him, one that married his fiancée in his absence, and one who knew Dantès was innocent but stood idly by and did nothing.</p>
			<p>The Count of Monte Cristo is another of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas">Alexandre Dumas’</a> thrilling adventure stories, possibly more popular even than <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas/the-three-musketeers/william-robson">The Three Musketeers</a></i>. Originally serialized in a French newspaper over the course of a year-and-a-half, it was enormously popular after its publication in book form, and has never been out of print since. Its timeless story of adventure, historical drama, romance, revenge, and Eastern mystery has been the source of over forty movies and TV series.</p>

		<summary type="text">An unjustly imprisoned man longs after both his love and his tulips.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After the conviction of two prominent politicians for sedition, Dumas’s story focuses on the trial of an accused collaborator: one Cornelius van Baerle, whose only wish is to grow his tulips in peace. His crowning achievement is set to be the impossible black tulip, a feat worth one hundred thousand guilders from the Horticultural Society of Haarlem, but before he can sprout the bulb he’s imprisoned with only the daughter of the prison warden to give him a glimmer of hope.</p>
			<p>Set a few decades after the tulip mania of the 1630s, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas">Alexandre Dumas’s</a> novel opens with a historical incident: the mob killing of Johan and Cornelius de Witt, then high up in the government. Dumas successfully balances the romance of the protagonist’s love for both the heroine and his precious tulip with a quest to prove his innocence and thwart the schemes of his rival tulip-fancier Boxtel. <i>The Black Tulip</i> was originally published in three volumes in French in 1850; presented here is the 1902 translation by publisher <abbr>P. F.</abbr> Collier &amp; Son.</p>

		<summary type="text">A jaded Russian fop’s disdain for the world catches up with him.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Eugene Onegin is bored: bored of the city, of parties, and of the superficial <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg social scene. So when a newly-deceased uncle leaves him his country mansion, he jumps at the chance to play the rural lord. There he meets his new neighbours Lenski, a young poet and stark contrast to Onegin’s affected nonchalance, and Tattiana, a dreamy but introverted romantic, and triggers a set of events with tragic consequences.</p>
			<p>Serialized over the course of seven years starting in 1825, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-pushkin">Pushkin’s</a> novel in verse was and is a huge influence on Russian literature. Its unusual verse structure combined with Pushkin’s own commentary on the social canvas of the time has meant that it has remained relevant and read to this day. <i>Eugene Onegine</i> has been translated into many different languages, and into many different formats including successful operas and films.</p>

		<summary type="text">Explorer Alexander Mackenzie details his journeys to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans in his personal journals.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-mackenzie">Alexander Mackenzie</a> was the first European to complete a land crossing of the continent of America north of Mexico, preceding the famous Lewis and Clark expedition by twelve years. In his journals he details two separate voyages: one up what is now known as the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789, and another to what is now Bella Coola on the Pacific Ocean in 1792 and 1793.</p>
			<p>Both journals provide a detailed description of the many difficulties in navigating and traveling in a country that had yet to be mapped. Having to rely on Native guides and rumors, and enduring hardships that almost beggar belief, Mackenzie and his team were able to achieve their objective of finding an east to west land crossing through the Rocky Mountains and to the Pacific Ocean. Although his route didn’t prove as practical as routes found by later explorers, Mackenzie has cemented himself as a key explorer of Western Canada.</p>

		<summary type="text">Eighty-five articles written by a group of U.S. Founding Fathers on why the proposed U.S. Constitution should be approved.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In early 1787, the Congress of the United States called a meeting of delegates from each state to try to fix what was wrong with the Articles of Confederation. The Articles had created an intentionally weak central government, and that weakness had brought the nation to a crisis in only a few years. Over the next several months, the delegates worked to produce the document that would become the U.S. Constitution.</p>
			<p>When Congress released the proposed Constitution to the states for ratification in the fall of 1787, reaction was swift: in newspapers throughout each state, columnists were quick to condemn the radical reworking of the nation’s formative document. In New York State, a member of the convention decided to launch into the fray; he and two other men he recruited began writing their own anonymous series defending the proposed Constitution, each one signed “Publius.” They published seventy-seven articles in four different New York papers over the course of several months. When the articles were collected and published as a book early the following year, the authors added another eight articles. Although many at the time guessed the true identities of the authors, it would be a few years before the authors were confirmed to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-hamilton_john-jay_james-madison">Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay</a>, Hamilton and Madison both being delegates at the convention.</p>
			<p>Although the articles’ influence on the Constitution’s ratification is debated—newspapers were largely local at the time, so few outside New York saw the articles—their influence on the interpretation of the Constitution within the judiciary is immense. They are a window not only into the structure and content of the document, but also the <em>reasons</em> for the structure and content, written by men who helped author the document. Consequently, they have been quoted almost 300 times in Supreme Court cases. They remain perhaps the best and clearest explanation of the document that is the cornerstone of the United States government.</p>

		<summary type="text">An account of the lives of a group of prostitutes in a brothel in southern Russia.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i lang="ru">Yama</i> (<i>The Pit</i>) recounts the lives of a group of prostitutes living and working in Anna Markovna’s brothel in the town of K⸺. The women, subject to effective slavery through the removal of their papers and onerous debts, act out a scene of easy affability every evening for the part ignorant, part monstrous clients, while keeping secret their own pasts and wished-for futures.</p>
			<p>The book was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aleksandr-kuprin">Kuprin’s</a> attempt to denormalize the cultural ambiguity of the legal brothels of the time. His dedication—“to mothers and youths”—expresses his desire that there should no longer be a silent acceptance of the actions of the “fathers, husbands, and brothers.” The novel was notable for portraying the inhabitants of the brothels as living, breathing people with their own hopes and desires, not purely as a plot point or scenario.</p>
			<p>The critical response was mixed: many found the subject matter beyond the pale. Kuprin himself placed his hopes on a favourable review from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, which didn’t come; but there was praise for <i lang="ru">Yama</i> as both social commentary and warning, and an appreciation for Kuprin’s attempt to detail the everyday lives of his subjects.</p>
			<p>The novel had a troubled genesis, with the first part taking nine years between initial proposal and first publication; the second and third parts followed five years later. It was a victim of the Russian censors who, tellingly, disapproved more of scenes involving officials visiting the brothels, than the brothels themselves. It was only later during preparations for an anthology of his work that an uncensored version was allowed to be released. This edition is based on the translation to English by Bernard Guilbert Guerney of that uncensored version, and was first published in 1922.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Russian officer battles disillusionment and unrequited love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the young age of twenty-two Sublieutenant Romashov has become an officer, but he’s already disillusioned with army life in the middle of nowhere, and the brutish and blood-thirsty natures of his commanders and peers. The only thing keeping him from outright depression is his growing infatuation with the wife of a fellow officer; an infatuation which, half-returned, leads inevitably towards the titular subject.</p>
			<p><i>The Duel</i> is regarded as the highlight of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aleksandr-kuprin">Kuprin’s</a> bibliography and was praised by famous Russian authors of the period including <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov</a>, Gorky, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ivan-bunin">Bunin</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>. It was published in 1905 in the middle of the failure of the Russian army in the Russo-Japanese war and widespread social unrest. Kuprin himself had military experience as a lieutenant, which shines through in the novel’s vivid depictions of the minutiae of officer life. <i>The Duel</i> was later adapted for both film and television in Russia. This edition is based on the 1916 translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Aleksandr Kuprin’s translated short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aleksandr-kuprin">Aleksandr Kuprin</a> was one of the most celebrated Russian authors of the early twentieth century, writing both novels (including his most famous, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aleksandr-kuprin/the-duel/george-allen-unwin"><i>The Duel</i></a>) and short fiction. Along with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ivan-bunin">Bunin</a>, he did much to draw attention away from the “great Russian novel” and to make short fiction popular. His work is famed for its descriptive qualities and sense of place, but it always centers on the souls of the stories’ subjects. The themes of his work are wide and varied, and include biblical parables, bittersweet romances, spy fiction, and farce, among many others. In 1920, under some political pressure, Kuprin left Russia for France, and his later work primarily adopts his new homeland for the setting.</p>
			<p>This collection comprises the best individual translations into English of each of his short stories and novellas available in the public domain, presented in chronological order of their translated publication.</p>

		<summary type="text">An aristocrat summons a group of “intelligentsia” to vacation in her Italian mansion.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Mrs. Aldwinkle, an English aristocrat of a certain age, has purchased a mansion in the Italian countryside. She wishes to bring a salon of intellectual luminaries into her orbit, and to that end she invites a strange cast of characters to spend time with her in her palazzo: Irene, her young niece; Ms. Thriplow, a governess-turned-novelist; Mr. Calamy, a handsome young man of great privilege and even greater ennui; Mr. Cardan, a worldly gentleman whose main talent seems to be the enjoyment of life; Hovenden, a young motorcar-obsessed lord with a speech impediment; and Mr. Falx, a socialist leader. To this unlikely cast is soon added Mr. Chelifer, an author with an especially florid, overwrought style that is wasted on his day job as editor of <i>The Rabbit Fancier’s Gazette</i>, and the Elvers, a scheming brother who is the guardian of his mentally-challenged sister.</p>
			<p>As this unlikely group mingles, they discuss a great many grand topics: love, art, language, life, culture. Yet very early on the reader comes to realize that behind the pompousness of their elaborate discussions lies nothing but vacuity—these characters are a satire of the self-important intellectuals of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aldous-huxley">Huxley’s</a> era.</p>
			<p>His skewering of their intellectual barrenness continues as the group moves on to a trip around the surrounding country, in a satire of the Grand Tour tradition. The party brings their English snobbery out in full force as they traipse around Rome, sure of nothing else except in their belief that Italy is culturally superior simply because it’s <em>Italy</em>.</p>
			<p>As the vacation winds down, we’re left with a biting lampoon of the elites who suppose themselves to be at the height of art and culture—the kinds of personalities that arise in every generation, sure of their own greatness but unable to actually contribute anything to the world of art and culture that they feel is so important.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young writer travels to an English countryside manor to spend the summer alongside a cast of outlandish leisure class intellectuals.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Denis, a young writer and poet, travels to an English countryside manor to spend the summer alongside a cast of outlandish leisure class intellectuals. The younger guests of the manor grapple with navigating love and sex within a post-Victorian society. Older guests and inhabitants obsess over trivialities from their vast libraries, eager to give a show of their knowledge to each other. The novel uses these interactions to paint a scathing representation of their insecurities and world views.</p>
			<p><i>Crome Yellow</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aldous-huxley">Aldous Huxley’s</a> first published novel. His inspiration for many of the characters came from his time spent at Garsington Manor, a haven for many writers and poets of the time.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of 1920s London socialites struggle with their futures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Theodore Gumbril Junior is fed up with his job as a teacher, and tries a new tack as an inventor of pneumatic trousers. The development and marketing of these is set against his attempts to find love, and the backdrop of his friends’ and acquaintances’ similar quest for meaning in what seems to them a meaningless world.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aldous-huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>, although primarily known these days for his seminal work <i>Brave New World</i>, gained fame in the 1920s as a writer of social satires such as this, his second novel. Condemned at the time for its frank treatment of sexuality and adultery—it was even banned in Australia—the book’s characters’ comic lack of stability following the society-wide alignment of the Great War still resonates today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor youth encounters picaresque adventures as he travels through 17th century Spain.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Gil Blas</i> isn’t the first picaresque novel, but it’s one of the genre’s most famous examples; it’s a novel that at one point in history was on the bookshelf of every good reader, and it has been featured in allusions across literature for centuries after its publication between 1715 and 1735.</p>
			<p>Gil Blas is the name of a Spanish boy born to a poor stablehand and a chambermaid. He’s educated by his uncle before leaving to attend a university, but on the way his journey is interrupted by a band of robbers, and his picaresque adventures begin. Blas embarks on a series of jobs, challenges, advances, setbacks, romances, and fights on his path through life, ultimately continuing to rise in station thanks to his affability and quick wit. On his way he encounters many different kinds of people, both honest and dishonest, as well as many different social classes. Blas’ series of breezy, episodic adventures give <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alain-rene-lesage">Lesage</a> an opportunity to satirize every stratum of society, from the poor, to doctors, the clergy, writers and playwrights, the rich, and even royalty.</p>
			<p>Though Lesage wrote in French, <i>Gil Blas</i> is ultimately a Spanish novel in nature: Blas himself is Spanish, and his adventures take place in Spain. The details Lesage wrote into the novel were so accurate that some accused him of lifting from earlier works, like <i>Marcos de Obregón</i> by Vicente Espinel; others even accuse it of being written by someone else, arguing that no Frenchman could know so much detail about Spanish life and society.</p>
			<p>Despite any controversy, <i>Gil Blas</i> was translated into English by Tobias Smollett in 1748. His translation was so complete that it became the standard translation up to the modern day.</p>

		<summary type="text">Hercule Poirot solves the mystery of a murder in an English country manor.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> isn’t just <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie’s</a> first <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/poirot">Poirot</a> novel, it was the only Poirot novel in the public domain until 2019. It was written on a bet that Christie couldn’t write a detective novel in which the reader couldn’t deduce the criminal. Her attempt laid the foundation for one of literature’s most famous detectives.</p>
			<p>In this novel we’re introduced to Poirot as he’s settling in to a new life in England. After a woman is murdered at the country estate he’s visiting, he has to use his detective skills to catch the criminal. <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> sets the stage for the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, and has everything you’d expect from a story rich in those classic detective fiction tropes.</p>

		<summary type="text">The famous detective Poirot and his sidekick Hastings are summoned to France to investigate the mysterious murder of a rich businessman.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Murder on the Links</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie’s</a> second <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/poirot">Poirot</a> novel, featuring the brilliant Belgian detective and his sidekick, Captain Hastings.</p>
			<p>In this characteristic whodunit, Poirot is summoned to a seaside town in northern France by a desperate letter from a rich businessman, who fears that he is being stalked. Poirot arrives to find the businessman already dead, his body lying facedown in an open grave on a golf course, a knife in his back—the victim of a mysterious murder. Over the coming days Poirot clashes wits with an arrogant Parisian detective, Giraud, while Hastings finds himself pining after a beautiful but shadowy American expatriate known to him only as “Cinderella.” Together, Poirot and Hastings unravel the intricate web of mystery and deceit behind the murder.</p>
			<p>Christie based this mystery after a real-life French murder case, and it’s believed that this is the first detective novel to use the phrase “the scene of the crime.”</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Hercule Poirot has retired to the English village of King’s Abbot, determined to use his little grey cells in the growing of vegetable marrows. But when Roger Ackroyd, a local businessman and former acquaintance of Poirot’s, is murdered, the man’s niece begs Poirot to investigate in order to clear her fiancé.

		<summary type="text">Anne Beddingfeld travels to South Africa after finding a cryptic note beside the body of a man whose death she witnessed in the London Underground.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After her father’s death, young Anne Beddingfeld moves to London with her meagre inheritance, hopeful and ready to meet adventure. She witnesses a fatal accident at a Tube station and picks up a cryptic note dropped by the anonymous doctor who appeared on the scene. When Anne learns of a murder at the estate that the dead man was on his way to visit, it confirms her suspicion that the man in the brown suit who lost the note was not a real doctor.</p>
			<p>With her clue in hand she gains a commission from the newspaper leading the search for the “man in the brown suit,” and her investigation leads her to take passage on a South Africa–bound ocean liner. On board, she meets a famous socialite, a fake missionary, a possible secret service agent, and the <abbr>M.P.</abbr> at whose estate the second murder occurred. She learns about a secretive criminal mastermind known only as the Colonel and of stolen diamonds connected to it all.</p>
			<p>During the voyage, she evades an attempt on her life, and in South Africa she escapes from a kidnapping and barely survives another attack on her at Victoria Falls. She falls in love, finds the diamonds, and discovers the truth about the two deaths in London that started it all. Finally, she confronts the mysterious criminal mastermind, the Colonel.</p>
			<p>Published in 1924 by the Bodley Head, <i>The Man in the Brown Suit</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie’s</a> fourth novel. Unlike the classic murder mysteries that made her famous, <i>The Man in the Brown Suit</i>, like her second novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie/the-secret-adversary">The Secret Adversary</a></i>, is an international crime thriller.</p>

		<summary type="text">Aesop’s classic Fables of behaviour and consequence.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Whether it’s the benefits of taking it slow and steady (“The Tortoise and the Hare”), the necessity of invention (“The Crow and the Pitcher”), or the problems of cognitive dissonance (“The Fox and the Grapes”), <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aesop">Aesop</a> has a fable for every occasion. Aesop lived in Greece in the 6th century BCE, far enough in the past that it’s become impossible to ascribe all these fables to him. Some were certainly retellings of older myths, some share their roots in collections of fables from India and further afield, and many were added well after his time. However, they all share a certain quality of prose that marks them out as belonging to the collection regardless of authorship. It’s that quality, combined with their insight into the human character, that has meant that they’ve stood the test of time for twenty-five centuries.</p>
			<p>This collection is the 1912 translation by V. S. Vernon Jones, comprising two hundred and eighty-four of the fables.</p>

		<summary type="text">Adam Smith lays the foundation of classical economics.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Wealth of Nations</i> is economist <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/adam-smith">Adam Smith’s</a> magnum opus and the foundational text of what today we call classical economics. Its publication ushered in a new era of thinking and discussion about how economies function, a sea change away from the older, increasingly-irrelevant mercantilist and physiocratic views of economics towards a new practical application of economics for the birth of the industrial era. Its scope is vast, touching on concepts like free markets, supply and demand, division of labor, war, and public debt. Its fundamental message is that the wealth of a nation is measured not by the gold in the monarch’s treasury, but by its national income, which in turn is produced by labor, land, and capital.</p>
			<p>Some ten years in the writing, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> is the product of almost two decades of notes, study, and discussion. It was released to glowing praise, selling out its first print run in just six months and going through five subsequent editions and countless reprintings in Smith’s lifetime. It began inspiring legislators almost immediately and continued to do so well into the 1800s, and influenced thinkers ranging from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-hamilton_john-jay_james-madison">Alexander Hamilton</a> to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels">Karl Marx</a>.</p>
			<p>Today, it is the second-most-cited book in the social sciences that was published before 1950, and its legacy as a foundational text places it in the stratosphere of civilization-changing books like <i>Principia Mathematica</i> and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-darwin/the-origin-of-species">The Origin of Species</a></i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of adventurers search for their friends, who were lost while exploring the otherworldly secrets of a monument discovered on a chain of island ruins.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Moon Pool</i>, in novel form, is a combination and fix-up of two previously-published short stories: “The Moon Pool,” and “Conquest of the Moon Pool.” Initially serialized in <i>All-Story Weekly</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/a-merritt">Merritt</a> made the interesting choice of framing the novel as a sort of scientific retelling, going so far as to include footnotes from fictional scientists, to give this completely fantastic work an air of authenticity.</p>
			<p>In it we find the adventuresome botanist William T. Goodwin embarking on a quest to help his friend Throckmortin, whose wife and friends have fallen victim to a mysterious temple ruin on a remote South Pacific island. A series of coincidences provides Goodwin with a colorful cast of accompanying adventurers, and they soon find themselves in a mysterious futuristic underworld.</p>
			<p><i>The Moon Pool</i> is an important entry in the Lost World genre, in no small part because it was a significant influence on <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a>—hints of <i>The Moon Pool</i> can be seen in his short story “The Call of Cthulhu,” and hints of Merritt’s Nan-Madol can be seen in Lovecraft’s R’lyeh.</p>
			<p>Today, <i>The Moon Pool</i> is a pulp classic, featuring many of the themes, tropes, and archetypes that characterized so many of the pulp adventure works of the era.</p>

		<summary type="text">An amateur sleuth visiting a country house solves the mystery of who shot the man in the locked room.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Red House Mystery</i> is a detective novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/a-a-milne"><abbr>A. A.</abbr> Milne</a>, better known for his children’s writing, who wrote this book for his father in 1922. It is his only mystery novel and was very popular at the time.</p>
			<p>Mark Ablett is the amiable host of a country-house party to which his estranged brother, Robert, arrives from Australia. Robert is the black sheep of the family who is said to have borrowed money in the past and had written to warn of his visit. One afternoon a gunshot is heard, and Robert is found shot in the head while locked in the library, while his brother Mark has vanished. Tony Gillingham, who has arrived to visit Bill Beverley, one of the guests at the house-party, takes it upon himself to investigate the death. Together Tony and Bill form a Holmes and Watson partnership and seek to solve the mystery in an unorthodox manner, taking over from a bumbling police force.</p>
			<p><i>The Red House Mystery</i> has divided opinion on its literary merit but it remains an entertaining and intriguing read nonetheless.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Ernest Hemingway’s short stories and novellas.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> is perhaps the most influential American writer of the twentieth century. Though known mostly for his longer works, he began his writing career with the publication of short stories which helped develop his often-imitated concise, simple, and straightforward style, which stood in stark contrast to the more elaborate prose of many of his contemporaries.</p>
			<p>In 1947, during a University of Mississippi creative writing class, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner</a> remarked that Hemingway “has never been known to use a word that might cause the reader to check with a dictionary to see if it is properly used.” Hemingway famously responded: “Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don’t know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.”</p>
			<p>Besides his writing style, Hemingway’s most well-known contribution to the literary landscape was the iceberg theory of writing, developed while composing the short story “Out of Season.” Hemingway later said of the story: “I had omitted the real end of it which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood.”</p>
			<p>This collection comprises all of the public domain stories published in Hemingway’s short story collections, some miscellaneous stories published in various magazines, and his novellas. With the exception of stories within collections with a thematic link, such as <i>In Our Time</i>, they are arranged in publication order.</p>

		<summary type="text">Former slave Julius tells fantastical tales about plantation life to the incredulous Northerners who have just moved in.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Conjure Woman</i> is a collection of fantastical stories narrated by Julius, a former slave, about life on the nearby plantations prior to the Civil War. Each involves an element of magic, be it a vine that dooms those who eat from it or a man transformed into a tree to avoid being separated from his wife. Julius’s audience, a married couple who have just moved to the South to cultivate grapes, listen on with mixed sympathy and disbelief. They disagree on whether Julius is telling the truth and whether there is some deeper significance to the tales. At turns humorous and unsettling, these stories provide a surprising lens into the realities of slavery.</p>
			<p>The text is notable for spelling out Julius’s spoken accent. Although Julius has some stereotypical features of a simple-minded old slave, he is often regarded as a more clever and complicated figure. He seems to tell his tales not only to entertain his listeners, but to trick them to his advantage.</p>
			<p>Many of these stories first appeared in national magazines, where they received popular acclaim, before being assembled as their own volume in 1899. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-w-chesnutt">Charles <abbr>W.</abbr> Chesnutt’s</a> race was not mentioned by the publisher, nor could many guess his African heritage based on his appearance. However, Chesnutt embraced his African-American identity and was a prominent activist for black rights. <i>The Conjure Woman</i>, his first book, is considered an important early work of African-American fiction.</p>
			<p>This edition includes four additional Julius tales that appeared in magazines but were not collected during Chesnutt’s lifetime.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young Australian man struggles to reclaim his love from the clutches of an evil mastermind.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-boothby">Guy Newell Boothby</a>, born in Adelaide, was one of the most popular of Australian authors in the late 19th and early 20th century, writing dozens of novels of sensational fiction.</p>
			<p><i>A Bid for Fortune, or <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Nikola’s Vendetta</i> is the first of his series of five books featuring the sinister mastermind <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Nikola, a character of gothic appearance usually accompanied by a large black cat, and who has powers of mesmerism.</p>
			<p>In this first novel, the protagonist is a young Australian, Richard Hatteras, who has made a small fortune in pearl-diving operations in the Thursday Islands. With money in his pocket, he decides to travel. Visiting Sydney before taking ship for England, he meets and falls in love with the daughter of the Colonial Secretary, Sylvester Wetherell. As the story moves on, it is revealed that Wetherell has fallen foul of the evil <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Nikola, who has developed a devious scheme to force Wetherell to submit in to his demands to give him a mysterious oriental object he has acquired. The life and liberty of Hatteras’ lady-love are imperilled as Nikola’s plot moves on, and Hatteras has to make strenuous efforts to locate and free her.</p>
			<p>Boothby’s novels, particularly the <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Nikola books, achieved considerable popular success, particularly in his native country of Australia. A study of library borrowings in the early 20th Century has shown that Boothby’s works were almost as frequently borrowed in Australia as those of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-rider-haggard"><abbr>H.</abbr> Rider Haggard</a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">An aspiring medical doctor struggles to lead the life of an ethical scientist during America’s Roaring Twenties.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Martin Arrowsmith, the titular protagonist, grows up in a small Midwestern town where he wants to become a doctor. At medical school he meets an abrasive but brilliant professor, Gottlieb, who becomes his mentor. As Arrowsmith completes his training he begins a career practicing medicine. But, echoing <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis">Lewis’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis/main-street">Main Street</a></i>, small-town life becomes too insular and restricting; his interest in research and not people makes him unpopular, and he decides to work in a research laboratory instead.</p>
			<p>From there Arrowsmith begins a career that hits all of the ethical quandaries that scientists and those in the medical profession encounter: everything from the ethical problem of research protocol strictness versus saving lives, to doing research for the betterment of mankind versus for turning a profit, to the politics of institutions, to the social problems of wealth and poverty. Arrowsmith struggles with these dilemmas because, like all of us, he isn’t perfect. Despite his interest in helping humanity, he has little interest in people—aside from his serial womanizing—and this makes the path of his career an even harder one to walk. He’s surrounded on all sides by icons of nobility, icons of pride, and icons of rapaciousness, each one distracting him from his calling.</p>
			<p>Though the book isn’t strictly a satire, few escape Lewis’s biting pen. He skewers everyone indiscriminately: small-town rubes, big-city blowhards, aspiring politicians, doctors of both the noble and greedy variety, hapless ivory-towered researchers, holier-than-thou neighbors, tedious gilded-age socialites, and even lazy and backwards islanders. In some ways, <i>Arrowsmith</i> rivals <i>Main Street</i> in its often-bleak view of human nature—though unlike <i>Main Street</i>, the good to humanity that science offers is an ultimate light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
			<p>The novel’s publication in 1925 made it one of the first serious “science” novels, exploring all aspects of the life and career of a modern scientist. Lewis was aided in the novel’s preparation by Paul de Kruif, a microbiologist and writer, whose medically-accurate contributions greatly enhance the text’s realist flavor.</p>
			<p>In 1926 <i>Arrowsmith</i> was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, but Lewis famously declined it. In his refusal letter, he claimed a disinterest in prizes of any kind; but the <i>New York Times</i> reported that those close to him say he was still angered over the Pulitzer’s last-minute snatching of the 1921 prize from <i>Main Street</i> in favor of giving it to <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton/the-age-of-innocence">The Age of Innocence</a></i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man in a relationship with a young woman decides he wants someone else, of a higher social class.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Clyde Griffith’s parents are poor street-preachers, but Clyde doesn’t “believe,” and finds their work demeaning. At fifteen he gets a job and starts to ease out of their lives, eventually landing in some trouble that causes him to flee the town where they live. Two years later, Clyde meets his well-off uncle, who owns a large factory in upstate New York. Clyde talks his way into a job at the factory, and soon finds himself supervising a roomful of women. All alone, generally shunned by his uncle’s family, and starved for companionship, he breaks the factory’s rules and begins a relationship with a young woman who works for him. But Clyde has visions of marrying a high-society woman, and fortune smiles on him in the form of the daughter of one of his uncle’s neighbors. Soon Clyde finds himself in a love triangle of his own making, and one from which he seems incapable of extracting himself.</p>
			<p>A newspaperman before he became a novelist, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/theodore-dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a> collected crime stories for years of young men in relationships with young women of poorer means, where the young men found a richer, prettier girl who would go with him, and often took extreme measures to escape from the first girl. <i>An American Tragedy</i>, based on one of the most infamous of those real-life stories, is a study in lazy ambition, the very real class system in America, and how easy it is to drift into evil. It is populated with poor people who desire nothing more than to be rich, rich people whose only concern is to keep up with their neighbors and not be associated with the “wrong element,” and elements of both who care far more about appearances than reality. It offers further evidence that the world may be very different from 100 years ago, but the people in it are very much the same.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of 34 essays and short stories, including “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle.”</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Initially published throughout 1819 and 1820, <i>The Sketch-Book</i> is a collection of 34 essays and short stories, collected and ordered according to the Author’s Revised Edition published in 1848. <i>The Sketch-Book</i> is the first publication to use <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/washington-irving">Irving’s</a> pseudonym Geoffrey Crayon, which he would carry into later works.</p>
			<p>The stories vary in nature, from the comical “The Mutability of Literature” to the eerie and seemingly supernatural “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” but the personality of their narrator, Geoffrey Crayon, connects the stories and attracts their readers. Some stories are written on American topics, forming the need for separate American and English editions, and others consist of English life and landscape, written from the perspective of living in England for a time.</p>
			<p>Two of the stories, “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle,” are Irving’s most well-known works, and are presented as posthumous writings of fictional Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker. From these stories came the iconic characters Rip Van Winkle, Ichabod Crane, and the Headless Horseman.</p>

		<summary type="text">As Clarissa Dalloway walks through London on a glorious June day, her movements bring together a cast of friends and strangers, each in turn weighing matters of mind and heart.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Probably <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf">Virginia Woolf’s</a> best-known novel, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, originally published in 1925, is a glorious, ground-breaking text. On the surface, it follows Clarissa Dalloway, an Englishwoman in her fifties, minute by minute through the June day on which she is having a party. At a deeper level, however, the novel demonstrates, through an effortless stream of consciousness, the connections formed in human interaction—whether these interactions are fleeting, or persist through decades.</p>
			<p>This is a novel to read and cherish, if only to marvel at Woolf’s linguistic acrobatics. Words and phrases swoop and soar like swallows. Woolf’s sentences are magnificent: sinuous, whirling, impeccably detailed. As narrative perspective shifts from character to character—sometimes within a single sentence—readers come to understand the oh-so-permeable barrier between self and other. Through Clarissa we meet Septimus Warren Smith, his wife Rezia, and a cast of dozens more, all connected by the “leaden circles” of Big Ben marking the passage of every hour, by the pavements of Bloomsbury that lead everywhere and nowhere. Modernist London has never been portrayed more sublimely: replete with birdsong and flowers, resplendent in sunshine, youthful yet eternal—and even in the aftermath of war and pandemic, resilient.</p>
			<p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is Woolf’s attempt to express that which may be inexpressible. It offers a close examination of how difficult it is, even when our hearts are brimming, to say what we really feel; and it examines the damage we inflict through our reticence with words, our withholding of love. It is a novel of the soul, and a work of immense beauty.</p>

			<p>The story is set in Reina de Los Angeles, a town in southern California circa 1800 when California was still a part of Mexico, and when Mexico was controlled by Spain. The Los Angeles of this time is populated by four societies that must coexist, but that coexistence is out of balance.</p>
			<p>The oldest and weakest group is the “natives” who live in the pueblo. Next come the clergy, the <i>friales</i> who first planted the orchards and who live in the missions. Then, the gentry, who live as dons and doñas on feudal estates, or haciendas. Finally, the land is ruled by the strongest of these powers, an unjust governor in San Francisco de Asis. He controls the army under whose rule the natives are abused, the <i>friales</i> mistreated, and the gentry disrespected. This is the story of a young man of “good blood” who decides he must restore balance to this frontier society.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/johnston-mcculley">Johnston McCulley</a> wrote stories of Zorro for forty years. This, his first Zorro story, was originally serialized in a magazine as <i>The Curse of Capistrano</i>. Señor Zorro went on to leave a deep impression on popular culture, and has appeared in the work of many other authors and artists, in many media, ever since.</p>
			<p>One reason the character of Zorro endures is that he carries on a tradition of daring and heroic figures, both literary and historic, who precede him. Best known perhaps are the medieval Robin Hood of English folklore whose “merry men” are reminiscent of Zorro’s “avengers,” and the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/scarlet-pimpernel">Scarlet Pimpernel</a> of revolutionary France. Lesser known is the real-life figure William Lamport, the “Irish Zorro,” whose statue still stands in Mexico City.</p>

		<summary type="text">King Vikram becomes trapped in a cycle of stories as he tries to capture a cunning vampire.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Baital Pachisi</i>, also known as <i>Vikram-Betaal</i>, is a collection of Hindu tales featuring King Vikramaditya as the hero. Eleven of these tales were adapted from Sanskrit to English by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/richard-f-burton">Richard <abbr>F.</abbr> Burton</a> as <i>Vikram and the Vampire</i>.</p>
			<p>A tantric yogi is after King Vikram’s life because of the wrongdoings of his father. He fools the brave king into bringing him Baital (a vampire) hanging from a <i>siras</i> tree. Baital, in turn, traps the king in an endless loop of stories. If King Vikram answers any question posed by the vampire during his storytelling, the vampire will escape back to the tree, and the king will have to start again. Will King Vikram be able to escape Baital’s trap? What doom awaits the king when finally meets his nemesis?</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>It takes a hardy people to survive farming the harsh lands of the French Canadian wilderness, and Maria Chapdelaine must choose either to remain Québécois in this unforgiving land that has broken her heart, or to pursue a softer urban life in foreign New England.</p>
			<p>French writer <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/louis-hemon">Louis Hémon</a> wrote <i>Maria Chapdelaine</i> during the two years he lived in Quebec, and it’s based on his experiences working on a farm in the Lac Saint-Jean region where the novel is set. It was his only work published in his lifetime, as he died in a tragic train accident before learning of its success.</p>
			<p>The novel is described as a masterwork that was Canada’s entry into world literature and Quebec’s introduction to the rest of the Francophone world. An enduring work, it has served as the basis of four movies, and has been adapted into plays, an illustrated novel, a radio novel, a television series, and an opera.</p>

		<summary type="text">After more than two hundred years of stability, a sudden surge in contraband fairy fruit threatens the peace and mental heath of citizens in the borderland town of Lud-in-the-Mist.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Two hundred years ago, merchants in the small country of Dorimare, weary of the capricious nature of the ruling class, cast out the aristocracy and established their own government. Believing that their former rulers’ erratic behavior was caused by their neighbors in Fairyland, the mention of anything fairy quickly became taboo among Dorimare’s citizens.</p>
			<p>Now, though, illicit trade of fairy fruit is on the rise in the border town of Lud-in-the-Mist and the government seems powerless to stop it. As influential families fall victim to the maddening effects of the fruit it becomes clear that someone is working to undermine the status quo, and the Mayor needs to discover who it is before it’s too late.</p>
			<p><i>Lud-in-the-Mist</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hope-mirrlees">Hope Mirrlees’s</a> third and most popular book. It has been reprinted several times, and was a part of the Fantasy Masterworks series produced by Orion Books. It has been referred to as a masterpiece of fantasy literature, with Neil Gaiman calling it “a little golden miracle of a book.”</p>

		<summary type="text">King Henry VI takes the throne during a time of great political division: the quarreling among English noblemen and the collapse of England’s hold in France.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>King Henry V has suddenly died, and the kingdom is in chaos. In England, noblemen are fighting amongst themselves. Loyalties are divided into two factions: the White Roses (York) and the Red Roses (Lancaster). The Duke of Gloucester, Henry VI’s Protector, is accused by Cardinal Beaufort of seizing the throne for himself.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile in France, the Dauphin Charles has been crowned the new king. English-held land once conquered by Henry V is quickly being recaptured by French forces. In one of these battles, the English hero Talbot is imprisoned. A French woman named Joan la Pucelle—also known as Joan of Arc—has been having visions that reveal to her how to defeat the English Army.</p>
			<p>The only thing that unifies the two countries is their pessimism towards the new English monarch. It is now Henry VI’s turn to rule over England, or die trying.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">Paine argues against the legitimacy of the Bible and institutional religion.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Age of Reason</i> is an important work in the American Deist movement. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-paine">Paine</a> worked on it continually for more than a decade, publishing it in three parts from 1794 through 1807. It quickly became a best-seller in post-Revolution America, spurring a revival in Deism as an alternative to the prevailing Christian influence.</p>
			<p>In clear, simple, and often funny language, Paine attempts to dissect the Bible’s supposed inaccuracies and hypocrisies. He portrays the Bible as a human construct, full of illogic, errors, and internal inconsistencies, as opposed to it being a text born of divine inspiration. On those arguments he pivots to decrying not just Christianity, but organized religion as a whole, as a human invention created to terrorize and enslave. Instead of accepting organized religion, he states that “his mind is his own church” and that man must embrace reason.</p>
			<p>While these arguments weren’t new to the wealthy and educated class of the era, they <em>were</em> new to the poor masses. The book was at first distributed as cheap unbound pamphlets, making it easily accessible to the poor; and Paine’s simple language was written in way the poor could understand and sympathize with. This made the powerful very nervous, and, fearing that the book could cause a potential revolution, Paine and his publishers were suppressed.</p>
			<p>Paine wrote <i>The Age of Reason</i> while living in Paris. In France, its thesis wasn’t revolutionary <em>enough</em> for the bloodthirsty Jacobins; he was imprisoned there for ten months and only escaped execution through a stroke of luck. Meanwhile in Britain, the government considered the pamphlets seditious. British booksellers and publishers involved in printing and distributing the pamphlets were repeatedly tried for seditious and blasphemous libel, with some even receiving sentences of hard labor.</p>
			<p>Paine began writing Part III after escaping France for America, but even the American elite thought the book too scandalous, with Thomas Jefferson—himself a Deist—advising Paine not to publish. Paine listened to Jefferson’s advice and held off publishing Part III for five years before publishing extracts as separate pamphlets. For that reason, Part III is not a concrete publication, but rather an arrangement of several loosely-related pamphlets organized at the discretion of an edition’s editor.</p>
			<p>Once it was in the hands of Americans, it sparked a revival in Deism in the United States before being viciously attacked from all sides. Paine earned a reputation as an agitator and blasphemer that stuck to him for the rest of his life.</p>
			<p>Despite <i>The Age of Reason</i>’s harsh reception—or perhaps, <em>because</em> of it, and the controversy and discussion it caused—it achieved a popularity in England, France, and America that gave it incredible influence in those nation’s perspectives on organized religion.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of fantastical short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Book of Wonder</i> is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lord-dunsany">Lord Dunsany’s</a> many collections of fantasy short stories. While many of his collections were illustrated, this particular one is different—the illustrations were completed <em>first</em>. Dunsany then used the illustrations as inspirations for the stories around them.</p>
			<p>This collection features fourteen short stories, all of them whimsical, imaginative, and deeply strange. Dunsany writes stories that don’t always have a happy ending, and these are no exception—though they’re written in an almost fairytale or allegorical style, they each have a melancholy, vengeful, or even mad edge to them.</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of five families in Russia during the Napoleonic Wars.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, five aristocratic families in Russia are transformed by the vagaries of life, by war, and by the intersection of their lives with each other. Hundreds of characters populate <i>War and Peace</i>, many of them historical persons, including Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I, and all of them come to life under <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy’s</a> deft hand.</p>
			<p><i>War and Peace</i> is generally considered to be Tolstoy’s masterpiece, a pinnacle of Russian literature, and one of history’s great novels. Tolstoy himself refused to call it that, saying it was “not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle.” It contains elements of history, narrative, and philosophy, the latter increasing in quantity as the book moves towards its climax. Whatever it is called, it is a triumph whose breadth and depth is perhaps unmatched in literature.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition restores the Russian given names that were anglicized by the Maudes in their translation, the use of Russian patronymics and diminutives that they eliminated, and Tolstoy’s original four-book structure.</p>

		<summary type="text">A widow marries beneath her station and against her brothers’ orders and, enraged, they take their revenge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-webster">John Webster</a> was a later contemporary of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, and <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>, Webster’s best known play, is considered among the best of the period. It appears to have been first performed in 1612–13 at the Blackfriars before moving on to the larger and more famous Globe Theatre, and was later published in 1623.</p>
			<p>The play is loosely based on a real Duchess of Amalfi, a widow who marries beneath her station. On learning of this, her brothers become enraged and vow their revenge. Soon the intrigue, deceit, and murders begin. Marked by the period’s love of spectacular violence, each character exacts his revenge, and in turn suffers vengeance at the hands of others. Coming after Shakespeare’s equally sanguine <i>Hamlet</i> and Kyd’s <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, Webster’s <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> brings to a close the era of the great Senecan tragedies of blood and revenge. As the Jacobean period progressed, the spectacle became more violent and dark, reflecting the public’s growing dissatisfaction with the corruption of King James’ court.</p>

		<summary type="text">The first-person narrative of the Martian invasion of 19th-century Earth.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells’</a> classic tale of alien invasion has to this day never been out of print. Like many works of the era, it was originally published as a serial—though the publisher, <i>Pearson’s Magazine</i>, demanded to know the ending before committing to publication.</p>
			<p><i>The War of the Worlds</i>, with its matter-of-fact narrative style and deft mixture of contemporary science and fictionalized interstellar war machines, became an instant hit. Its themes of colonialism, social Darwinism, good and evil, and total war still resonate with modern-day readers, so much so that it’s been continuously adapted for screen, radio, television, comics, and print.</p>

		<summary type="text">A renowned novelist describes the unique relation that links him to his dog.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>Bashan and I</i> (sometime referred to as <i>Man and Dog</i>), <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-mann">Thomas Mann</a>, the Nobel Prize-winning author of <i>The Magic Mountain</i> and <i>Death in Venice</i>, writes in the most remarkable way of the unique relation that links a dog with his master. These memoirs read as a novel, and describe in fierce detail the behavior, feelings and psychology of Mann’s dog Bashan, and of Mann himself. Mann tells how he acquired Bashan, details traits of his character, and describes how they go on harmless and bucolic hunts.</p>
			<p>Written in 1918 at the end of the First World War, <i>Bashan and I</i> is an ode to life, to nature, to simple joys, and to a dog.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man awakes in Fairy Land, where he takes part in a series of strange adventures.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Phantastes</i> was published in 1858. It tells the story of Anodos, who, on coming of age, is examining the effects of his deceased father. To his astonishment, in doing so he sees an apparition of a fairy woman, who tells him that he has some fairy blood and conveys him to Fairy Land.</p>
			<p>In Fairy Land Anodos undergoes a long series of strange adventures and spiritual experiences. He is frequently under threat, at first from malevolent trees, and later from his own evil Shadow. At one point he discovers Pygmalion’s cave and sees the form of a beautiful woman enclosed in transparent alabaster. He falls instantly in love with this woman and contrives to free her from the stone, but she flees from him. Later, he encounters the Arthurian knight Sir Percivale, who has just come off the worst of an encounter with the evil Maid of the Alder-Tree. Eventually, after many trials and hazards, Anodos encounters Sir Percivale again and becomes his squire. Together they carry out deeds of chivalry before Anodos eventually returns to the mundane world.</p>
			<p><i>Phantastes</i> is now regarded as a classic of the fantasy genre and has been an important influence on later generations of fantasy writers, including such names as C. S. Lewis.</p>

		<summary type="text">The First United States Volunteer Cavalry fights in the Spanish–American War.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>With the destruction of the <i>Maine</i> and other events leading to the Spanish–American War, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/theodore-roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in order to go to the front. Under Colonel Leonard Wood, Roosevelt raised and trained the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, who were quickly nicknamed the “Rough Riders.” The regiment received a surplus of volunteers, with a mix of recruits ranging from Southwestern cowboys to Ivy League scholars.</p>
			<p>Logistical difficulties challenged the regiment almost immediately in their transit to Cuba. Before sailing from Tampa, they were forced to leave behind four of the twelve total companies and almost all of their horses. As an officer, Roosevelt kept his horse, which he rode to lead the charge in the Battle of San Juan Hill. Roosevelt recalled the battle as “the great day of my life” and “my crowded hour.”</p>
			<p>After winning the war, the onset of yellow fever, malaria, and other incapacitating diseases made it imperative to return the soldiers home quickly. Along with nine generals, Roosevelt drafted and signed a “round robin” letter, which was also published nationwide to turn public attention toward returning the troops. Back home, Roosevelt initially published the work serially in <i>Scribner’s Magazine</i> in 1899, and its popularity contributed to his rise as a national figure.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Robert E. Howard’s short stories, including the barbarian adventures of Conan the Cimmerian.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Conan, the Cimmerian barbarian, romps across the pages of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-e-howard">Robert <abbr>E.</abbr> Howard’s</a> Hyborian adventures, slicing down enemy after enemy and trying not to fall too hard for a succession of ladies in need of rescue. Although very much a product of the pulp fantasy magazines of the 1930s, Conan has surpassed his contemporaries to become the quintessential barbarian of the fantasy genre: the muscle-bound and instinct-led hero, always willing to fight his way out of any fix.</p>
			<p>Collected here are Howard’s public domain short stories, including ten Conan short stories and the history of Hyboria that Howard wrote as a guide for himself to write from. <i>Gods of the North</i> originally was a Conan story, but after being rejected by the first publisher was rewritten slightly to a character called Amra; it was later republished as <i>The Frost-Giant’s Daughter</i> with the name changed back. The stories were serialised (with a couple of exceptions) in <i>Weird Tales</i> magazine between 1925 and 1936, and have gone on to spawn multiple licensed and unlicensed sequels, comics, films and games.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of O. Henry short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>William Sydney Porter, known to readers as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/o-henry"><abbr>O.</abbr> Henry</a>, was a true raconteur. As a draftsman, a bank teller, a newspaper writer, a fugitive from justice in Central America, and a writer living in New York City, he told stories at each stop and about each stop. His stories are known for their vivid characters who come to life, and sometimes death, in only a few pages. But the most famous characteristic of <abbr>O.</abbr> Henry’s stories are the famous “twist” endings, where the outcome comes as a surprise both to the characters and the readers. <abbr>O.</abbr> Henry’s work was widely recognized and lauded, so much so that a few years after his death an award was founded in his name to recognize the best American short story (now stories) of the year.</p>
			<p>This collection gathers all of his available short stories that are in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> public domain. They were published in various popular magazines of the time, as well as in the Houston <i>Post</i>, where they were not attributed to him until many years after his death.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of ghost stories written by M. R. James.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/m-r-james">Montague Rhodes James</a> was a respected scholar of medieval manuscripts and early biblical history, but he is best remembered today as a writer of ghost stories. His work has been much esteemed by later writers of horror, from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> to Steven King.</p>
			<p>The stereotypical Jamesian ghost story involves a scholar or gentleman in a European village who, through his own curiosity, greed, or simple bad luck, has a horrifying supernatural encounter. For example, in “ ‘Oh, Whistle, and I’ll Come to You, My Lad,’ ” a professor finds himself haunted by a mysterious figure after blowing a whistle found in the ruins of a Templar church, and in “Count Magnus,” a writer’s interest in a mysterious and cruel figure leads to horrific consequences. Other stories have the scholar as an antagonist, like “Lost Hearts” and “Casting the Runes,” where study of supernatural rites gives way to practice. James’ stories find their horror in their atmosphere and mood, and strike a balance in their supernatural elements, being neither overly descriptive nor overly vague.</p>
			<p>This collection includes all the stories from his collections <i>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i>, <i>More Ghost Stories</i>, <i>A Thin Ghost and Others</i>, and <i>A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">An Englishman accompanies a group of doctors and nurses on the Russian side of the Eastern Front during World War I.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>John Durward and John Trenchard are two Englishmen who join a company of Russian doctors, nurses, and orderlies working on the Russian side of the Eastern Front at the height of World War I. Durward, the primary narrator, is a detached and seemingly-objective observer of events; his friend Trenchard is a dreamy, clumsy, and naive man whose fiancee, Marie Ivanova, is serving alongside him as a nurse.</p>
			<p>The narrative follows the unlikely group as they are embedded in the Front, treating casualties and cholera victims while dodging shellings and enemy ambushes. At first the group seems to get along well enough, until Semyonov, a dark, charismatic, hyper-masculine doctor in their company, sets his romantic sights on Ivanova.</p>
			<p>As the medics desperately try to fulfill their duty among the brutal backdrop of the war, their intricate relationships become the centerpiece of a complex emotional narrative that winds through the dark forest, a symbol of the confusing shadows that can lie between even two people bonded by wartime.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hugh-walpole">Walpole</a> served in the Russian Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front during World War I, and his real-life experiences are reflected in the narrative. On its publication <i>The Dark Forest</i> was called “the best picture of life in a field-ambulance on the Eastern Front that has yet been written” by the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and it was popular enough for Walpole to write a sequel, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hugh-walpole/the-secret-city"><i>The Secret City</i></a>, which went on to win the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction</a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">The diary of a man living in London in the 17th century.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-pepys">Pepys’</a> <i>Diary</i> is a decade-long snapshot of the life of an up and coming naval administrator in mid-17th century London. In it he describes everything from battles against the Dutch and the intrigues of court, to the plays he saw, his marital infidelities, and the quality of the meat provided for his supper. His incredibly frank observations have proved invaluable in establishing an accurate record of the daily life of the people of London of that period.</p>
			<p>Pepys eventually stopped keeping the diary due to progressive deterioration of his eyesight, fearing that continuing to write would worsen the condition. He did consider employing an amanuensis to transcribe future entries for him, but worried that the content he wanted written would be too personal. Luckily for Pepys, his eyesight difficulties never progressed to blindness and he was able to go on to become both a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society, but he never resumed his diarism.</p>
			<p>After Pepys’ death he left his large library of books and manuscripts first to his nephew, which was then passed on to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where it survives to this day. The diary, originally written in a shorthand, was included in this trove and was eventually deciphered in the early 19th century, and published by Lord Baybrooke in 1825. This early release censored large amounts of the text, and it was only in the 1970s that an uncensored version was published. Presented here is the 1893 edition, which restores the majority of the originally censored content but omits “a few passages which cannot possibly be printed.” The rich collection of endnotes serves to further illustrate the lives of the people Pepys meets and the state of internal politics and international relations during the English Restoration.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young Australian man and his brother are led into a life of crime, becoming cattle stealers, bank robbers and bushrangers before being caught.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Robbery Under Arms</i>, subtitled <i>A Story of Life and Adventure in the Bush and in the Goldfields of Australia</i>, was published in serial form in the <i>Sydney Mail</i> newspaper between July 1882 and August 1883. It was published under the name of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rolf-boldrewood">Rolf Boldrewood</a>, a pseudonym for Thomas Alexander Browne, a police magistrate and gold commissioner.</p>
			<p><i>Robbery Under Arms</i> is an entertaining adventure story told from the first person point of view of Richard “Dick” Marston. The story is in the form of a journal written from jail where he’s waiting to be hanged for his crimes. Marston and his brother Jim are led astray as young men by their father, who made money by cattle “duffing,” or stealing. They are introduced to their father’s associate, known only as Captain Starlight, a clever and charming fraudster. After a spell in jail, from which he escapes, Marston, his brother, and father are persuaded by Starlight to operate as bank robbers and bushrangers. They embark on a life continually on the run from the police. Despite this, Dick and Jim also manage to spend a considerable time prospecting for gold, and the gold rush and the fictitious gold town of Turon are described in detail.</p>
			<p>The character of Captain Starlight is based largely on the real-life exploits of bushrangers Harry Redford and Thomas Smith, the latter known as “Captain Midnight.”</p>
			<p>Regarded as a classic of Australian literature, <i>Robbery Under Arms</i> has never been out of print, and has been the basis of several adaptations in the form of films and television serials.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is unabridged, and restores some 30,000 words from the original serialization which were cut out of the 1889 one-volume edition of the novel.</p>

			<p>Six years after the events of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz/with-fire-and-sword/jeremiah-curtin"><i>With Fire and Sword</i></a> the Polish Commonwealth has recovered from the earlier bloody wars against the Cossacks and the Crimean Khanate, but the King is being kept busy by skirmishes on the Russian border. Unfortunately for the Commonwealth, this wealthy land is all too tempting for the Swedish king Karl Gustav who sweeps in to claim his prize, forcing soldiers and nobles to reconsider where their loyalties truly lie. This backdrop allows the impetuous Pan Andrei Kmita to demonstrate all sides of his loyalty and recklessness, even at the expense of his comrades and his fiancée Panna Aleksandra Billevich.</p>
			<p><i>The Deluge</i> is the second book in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz">Henryk Sienkiewicz’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/the-trilogy">trilogy of novels</a> dealing with a series of wars in seventeenth-century Poland. Written two years after <i>With Fire and Sword</i>, it was serialized in the newspaper that Sienkiewicz was editor-in-chief of, and started to cement his reputation as an novelist.</p>
			<p>Throughout the Trilogy Sienkiewicz weaves historical events and people with fictional characters and stories to great effect; this mastery of the historical epic went on to earn him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905. This edition is based on the 1891 translation by Jeremiah Curtin.</p>

		<summary type="text">A country vicar and his family are subjected to a series of unfortunate events.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Though published in 1766, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i> was one of the most popular and widely-read books of the Victorian era. References to <i>Vicar</i> in Victorian literature abound: George Eliot, Austen, Dickens, Mary Shelly, Charlotte Brontë, Alcott, Goethe, and many more famous writers all mention <i>Vicar</i> in their books.</p>
			<p>The plot concerns the titular vicar, Charles Primrose, a mild-mannered and forgiving man who lives with his family in a country parish. His prosperity comes from careful investments of his inheritance—but when one of his business partners goes bankrupt, the vicar finds himself suddenly impoverished.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the reason for <i>Vicar</i>’s long-lasting appeal is its careful balance between its being interpreted as either a sincere sentimental novel, or a satire of sentimental novels. Primrose is an oblivious protagonist, totally helpless against the evil forces of the world that constantly buffet him and his family. Despite this, the almost-ridiculous plot always manages to find a deus ex machina to save him from his latest calamity. The plot is so unbelievable that the reader is led to think that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oliver-goldsmith">Goldsmith</a> <em>must</em> have meant <i>Vicar</i> as a satire—and yet the novel is so earnest that the reader is left wondering.</p>
			<p>In the end, Primrose and his family serve as warnings to the reader to not be as heedless and powerless as they. The family’s constant deliverance from the disasters they blunder in to are Goldsmith’s way of saying that life is really not so Panglossian as one might want to believe, and that bad things can and do happen to good people—though in real life, rarely does a hero appear for a last-minute rescue. This worldview, which is so contrary to the Victorian’s ideals of romance and sentimentalism, may be what made it so popular as a satire in that era.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of pastoral poems that is considered the defining text for the beginning of Romantic-era literature.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is a collection of poems by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-wordsworth_samuel-taylor-coleridge">William Wordsworth and his friend and contemporary Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>. A hugely influential work, <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is generally acknowledged to have started the Romantic movement in English literature—a period marked by a departure from the stiff and unapproachable poetry of earlier times, and by a focus on readable, relatable verse written in everyday language. Many of Wordsworth’s poems focus on the natural world and the down-to-earth people of the country, another far departure from the rational and dry literature of old. Romanticism was one of the largest sea changes in modern English literature, and <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> was its catalyst.</p>
			<p>This ebook edition is based on the 1805 edition of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, and features the famous poems <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, “Tintern Abbey,” “Expostulation and Reply,” “Lucy Gray,” and many others.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Othello</i> was written in 1603 and first performed in 1604. The underlying story is based on “A Moorish Captain,” one of the stories in Cinthio’s <i>Gli Hecatommithi</i>, written in 1565.</p>

		<summary type="text">An ambitious general murders the King of Scotland and takes the throne for himself—and then he must deal with the consequences.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>King Duncan’s closest generals, Macbeth and Banquo, have just defeated two invading armies and the Irish rebel Macdonwald. Out across the misty moor, they encounter three witches who reveal to Macbeth a powerful prophecy: “All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis! All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!” They not only claim that Macbeth will eventually become King of Scotland, but that Banquo will father a line of Scottish kings—though ominously, Banquo will never be king himself.</p>
			<p>This shocking tragedy—a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake—is, to this day, one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> most popular and influential masterpieces.</p>

		<summary type="text">Forced to flee to the Forest of Arden, the daughter of a duke encounters a variety of characters, her banished father, and even finds love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In a French duchy, the old Duke has been usurped by his younger brother, Frederick. A young man named Orlando is mistreated by his elder brother, against their dead father’s wishes. Rosalind, the old Duke’s daughter, has been allowed to remain in court only because she is the closest friend of Celia, Duke Frederick’s daughter. When Rosalind is banished from court, she flees to the Forest of Arden with Celia and Touchstone, the court fool; meanwhile, Orlando also escapes to the forest, fleeing his brother. In the Forest of Arden, the old Duke holds court with exiled supporters, including the melancholy Jacques. There, Rosalind disguises herself as Ganymede and offers advice to a group of would-be lovers: Orlando, who has taken to posting love poems dedicated to Rosalind on trees, and Silvius and Phebe, two young shepherds.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> is thought to have written <i>As You Like It</i> around 1599; while stylistic analysis has not conclusively established its place in the canon, it was certainly completed by August 1600 and was published in the First Folio in 1623. There are no certain dates of performance until the 17th century, but it may have been performed in 1599 or 1603. The play includes a number of Shakespeare’s most famous speeches, including Jacques’ monologue, “All the world’s a stage.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A beautiful and virtuous young lady is entangled in the snares of a handsome but unscrupulous rake.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Clarissa Harlowe, or The History of a Young Lady</i> is one of the longest novels in the English language. Written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-richardson">Samuel Richardson</a> over a period of several years and published in 1748, it is composed entirely of letters. Though this may seem daunting, the novel is highly regarded and is considered by many critics as one of the greatest works of English literature, appearing in several lists of the best British novels ever written.</p>
			<p>The novel tells the story of young Clarissa, eighteen years of age at the start of the novel. She is generally regarded by her family, neighbors, and friends as the most virtuous and kind young woman they know. But she is drawn into correspondence with Richard Lovelace, a well-born, rich young man regarded as something of a rake, when she attempts to reconcile a dispute between Lovelace and her rash brother. Lovelace, imagining this indicates her love for him, carries out a series of strategems which result in him essentially abducting her from her family, from whom Clarissa then becomes estranged.</p>
			<p>Much of the correspondence consists of the letters between Clarissa and her close friend Anna Howe, and between Lovelace and his friend Jack Belford, to whom he confesses all of his strategems and “inventions” in his assault on Clarissa’s honor.</p>
			<p>The novel is thus a fascinating study of human nature. Much of Lovelace’s actions and attitudes towards women are regrettably only too familiar to modern readers. And while Clarissa herself may be a little too good to be true, nevertheless she is shown as having some flaws which lead to a tragic outcome.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on the 9-volume Chapman and Hall edition of 1902.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wealthy young woman decides to take on the role of patroness and matchmaker to a young protégé, with considerably less than successful results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Emma</i> is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-austen">Jane Austen’s</a> best-loved novels. Its eponymous heroine, Emma Woodhouse, has lived a pampered, protected life and consequently is somewhat unrealistic when she sets her sights on becoming a matchmaker for a young friend.</p>
			<p>The novel provides a light-hearted insight into the distinctions of the rigid class structure of England in the Regency period, and the social barriers to marriage between persons considered to be of superior and inferior rank.</p>
			<p><i>Emma</i> was published in 1815, the last of Austen’s novels to be published while she still lived. It received a generally very positive reception, and was well reviewed (though anonymously) by Sir Walter Scott. Criticisms of the novel, such as they were, centered around its supposed lack of plot, though its treatment of character was recognized and applauded. Today it is regarded as one of Austen’s best works. The novel has been adapted many times for theater, movies and television.</p>

		<summary type="text">An arrogant upper-class professor bets a colleague he can transform a simple flower girl into a “Duchess” in just six months.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Pygmalion</i> is a 5-act play by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-bernard-shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>. It was written in 1912 and first produced in 1913. The plot revolves around Professor Henry Higgins’ bet with a colleague over whether he can transform a low-class flower girl, Liza Doolittle, into the equivalent of a Duchess in just 6 months. Pygmalion was a Greek mythological figure who fell in love with a sculpture he had carved and was a popular theme in Victorian drama.</p>
			<p>Most people would be familiar with the characters Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins from the hit 1956 musical <i>My Fair Lady</i>, which was adapted from <i>Pygmalion</i>, though the plots differ in small but significant ways. In particular Shaw wanted to avoid any sense of a “happy ending” and, after viewing a performance of the play where an extra scene had been added, he wrote a sequel which definitively states what came after. The sequel was included in the published edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">Jack Tanner flees both London and responsibility when he is made guardian of his childhood friend Ann Whitehead.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Following the death of her father, Ann Whitefield becomes the ward of Jack Tanner and Roebuck Ramsden; Jack is a childhood friend, author of <i>The Revolutionist’s Handbook</i>, and descendant of Don Juan, while Roebuck Ramsden is a respectable friend of her father’s entirely opposed to Jack’s philosophy. Also in mourning are Octavius Robinson, who is openly in love with Ann, and his sister Violet, who is secretly pregnant. So begins a journey that will take them across London, Europe, and to Hell.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-bernard-shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> wrote <i>Man and Superman</i> between 1901 and 1903. It was first performed in 1905 with the third act excised; a part of that third act, <i>Don Juan in Hell</i>, was performed in 1907. The full play was not performed in its entirety until 1915.</p>
			<p>Shaw explains that he wrote <i>Man and Superman</i> after being challenged to write on the theme of Don Juan. Once described as Shaw’s most allusive play, <i>Man and Superman</i> refers to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche">Nietzsche’s</a> concept of the <i>Übermensch</i>. It combines Nietzsche’s argument that humanity is evolving towards a “superman” with the philosophy of Don Juan as a way to present his conception of society: namely, that it is women who are the driving force behind natural selection and the propagation of the species. To this end, Shaw includes as an appendix <i>The Revolutionist’s Handbook and Pocket Companion</i> as written by the character Jack Tanner.</p>

		<summary type="text">Wollaston attempts to derive ethics and religion by using rational thought and observation of the natural world, without resorting to revelation or received religion.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-wollaston">Wollaston</a> attempts to determine what rules for the conduct of life (that is, what <em>religion</em>) a conscientious and penetrating observer might derive simply from reasoning about the facts of the world around him, without benefit of divine revelation. He concludes that truth, reason, and morality coincide, and that the key to human happiness and ethical behavior is this: “let us by no act deny anything to be true which is true; that is: let us act according to reason.”</p>
			<p>This book was important to the intellectual foundations of the American Revolution (for example, the phrase “the pursuit of happiness” originates here). It also anticipates Kant’s theory of the categorical imperative and the modern libertarian non-aggression principle.</p>
			<p>This edition improves on its predecessors by, for the first time, providing both translations and sources for the over 650 footnotes that, in Wollaston’s original, are cryptically-attributed Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor Irish rogue tries to win fame and fortune in the 18th-century English aristocracy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Luck of Barry Lyndon</i> was first published as a serial in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>, then later as a complete volume entitled <i>The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.</i>—a title <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-makepeace-thackeray">Thackeray</a> disliked, but that was selected by his publisher. Thackeray had great difficulty composing the novel, and found himself frequently frustrated in his attempts to get Barry out of yet another jam. Ultimately he was displeased with his work, and considered it one of his lesser novels.</p>
			<p>Despite Thackeray’s neglect, <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is a bright satire filled with many genuinely funny moments. Barry is the quintessential unreliable narrator, and through his outrageous boasts and tall tales he becomes not just the target of the satire, but its very agent as well. Fortunately modern critics have viewed <i>Barry Lyndon</i> in a much more favorable light than Thackeray’s contemporaries, and even Thackeray himself: today it’s considered by some critics as one of his finest works.</p>

		<summary type="text">An account of the terrifying metaphysical haunting of a recluse’s secluded home.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The House on the Borderland</i> is unique in several ways. The narrative itself is a double-frame narrative: the editor of the volume is presenting a manuscript he found under mysterious circumstances, describing the account of two fishermen who themselves discovered a hand-written account of the cosmic haunting of a recluse’s remote home.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the novel is one of the earliest examples of the departure of horror fiction from the Gothic style of supernatural, psychological hauntings, to more realist, science-fiction/cosmic horror themes. The recluse is, among other events, transported to a mysterious supra-universal plane populated by monsters and elder gods; and his house withstands assaults from legions of monsters as he travels across time and the solar system.</p>
			<p>The book was very influential on <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a>, who himself was famous for the cosmic horror themes in his work. The concept of an uncaring, and even evil, universe that Lovecraft found so disturbing is front and center in this supremely strange novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">American soldiers returning from the First World War meet a scarred and lethargic comrade and help him reach home.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner’s</a> first published novel. It begins with a train journey on which two American soldiers, Joe Gilligan and Julian Lowe, are returning from the First World War. They meet a scarred, lethargic, and withdrawn fighter pilot, Donald Mahon, who was presumed dead by his family. The novel continues to focus on Mahon and his slow deterioration, and the various romantic complications that arise upon his return home.</p>
			<p>Faulkner drew inspiration for this novel from his own experience of the First World War. In the spring of 1918, he moved from his hometown, Oxford, Mississippi, to Yale and worked as an accountant until meeting a Canadian Royal Air Force pilot who encouraged him to join the R.A.F. He then traveled to Toronto, pretended to be British (he affected a British accent and forged letters from British officers and a made-up Reverend), and joined the R.A.F. in the hopes of becoming a hero. But the war ended before he was able to complete his flight training, and, like Julian Lowe, he never witnessed actual combat. Upon returning to Mississippi, he began fabricating various heroic stories about his time in the air force (like narrowly surviving a plane crash with broken legs and metal plates under the skin), and proudly strode around Oxford in his uniform.</p>
			<p>Faulkner was encouraged to write <i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> by his close friend and fellow writer <a hrei="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sherwood-anderson">Sherwood Anderson</a>, whom Faulkner met in New Orleans. Anderson wrote in his <i>Memoirs</i> that he went “personally to Horace Liveright”—<i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> was originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright—“to plead for the book.”</p>
			<p>Though the novel was a commercial failure at the time of its publication, Faulkner’s subsequent fame has ensured its long-term success.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two lovers are prevented from marrying due to a previous dalliance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-congreve">William Congreve’s</a> comedy <i>The Way of the World</i> was first performed in 1700 at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London. It was not well received, and as a result Congreve vowed never to write for the stage again—a vow he kept. Nonetheless the comedy was printed in the same year and has come to be regarded as the author’s masterpiece, a classic of Restoration drama.</p>
			<p>In a world still reacting against the puritanism of Cromwell and the Commonwealth, Restoration drama had slowly transitioned from celebrating the licentiousness and opulence of the newly returned court to the more thoughtful and refined comedy of manners that was to dominate the English stage of 18th century. In one way Congreve’s <i>The Way of the World</i> is the last (and best) of its type, and in another way, it is the forerunner of a style that is echoed even now.</p>
			<p>The play centers on the love affair of Mirabell and Millamant who are prevented from marrying by a number of obstacles, not the least of which is Mirabell’s past dalliance with Millamant’s aunt’s affections. Intricate, witty, and amusing, the comedy nevertheless concludes with no clear heroes or heroines—one of the things that makes it such an incisive portrait of human experience and an enduring example of its type.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Wilfred Owen’s published poems.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilfred-owen">Wilfred Owen</a> was a soldier and poet during the second half of the first World War. His poetry, contrary to the propaganda of the time, dealt with the horrors of front-line trench warfare and was written at least partially out of a sense of duty to tell of the realities of war. Most of his poetry was published posthumously in 1920 after his death in combat in November 1918, a mere week before the armistice was signed.</p>
			<p>His poetry, along with that of his close friend Siegfried Sassoon, is now regarded as an authentic voice of the experiences of the soldiers of the War. Held in especially high regard are <i lang="la">Dulce Et Decorum Est</i> with its vivid description of a gas attack, and <i>Anthem for Doomed Youth</i>. The poems are here presented in chronological order according to the date of final revision.</p>

			<p><i>Candide</i> is the picaresque tale of the titular character’s fantastical journey from an insular, idealized life in a picturesque castle through the difficulties and evils of the real world. Satirical, comical, witty, and cutting, <i>Candide</i> was widely banned in its day for containing blasphemous and seditious concepts. Despite that, it survived controversy to become an important book in the Western literary heritage. Today <i>Candide</i> remains a breezy and darkly funny read.</p>

		<summary type="text">A working-class Lithuanian immigrant family’s struggle to make a living in the turn-of-the-century Chicago stockyards.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Jungle</i> is one of the most famous muckraking novels in modern history. Set in Chicago at the dawn of the 20th century, it tells the story of an immigrant Lithuanian family trying to make it in a new world both cruel and full of opportunity. Their struggles are in part a vehicle for <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/upton-sinclair">Sinclair</a> to shine a spotlight on the monstrous conditions of the meatpacking industry, to expose the brutal exploitation of immigrants and workers, and to espouse his more socialist worldview.</p>
			<p>The novel is in part responsible for the passage of the revolutionary Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug act, and thus the establishment of the modern-day Food and Drug administration in the U.S. Its impact is in no small part due to the direct and powerful prose Sinclair employs: the horrors of commercial meat production are presented in full and glistening detail, and the tragedies and misfortunes of the Rudkus family are direct and relatable even today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A rough American from a distant branch of the Trenchard family returns to England and quickly becomes embroiled in the family’s affairs.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Our American Cousin</i> is a three-act play written by English playwright <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/tom-taylor">Tom Taylor</a>. The play opened in London in 1858 but quickly made its way to the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and premiered at Laura Keene’s Theatre in New York City later that year. It remained popular in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and England for the next several decades. Its most notable claim to fame, however, is that it was the play <abbr>U.S.</abbr> President Abraham Lincoln was watching on April 14, 1865 when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, who used his knowledge of the script to shoot Lincoln during a more raucous scene.</p>
			<p>The play is a classic Victorian farce with a whole range of stereotyped characters, business, and many entrances and exits. The plot features a boorish but honest American cousin who travels to the aristocratic English countryside to claim his inheritance, and then quickly becomes swept up in the family’s affairs. An inevitable rescue of the family’s fortunes and of the various damsels in distress ensues.</p>
			<p><i>Our American Cousin</i> was originally written as a farce for an English audience, with the laughs coming mostly at the expense of the naive American character. But after it moved to the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> it was eventually recast as a comedy where English caricatures like the pompous Lord Dundreary soon became the primary source of hilarity. This early version, published in 1869, contains fewer of that character’s nonsensical adages, which soon came to be known as “Dundrearyisms,” and for which the play eventually gained much of its popular appeal.</p>

		<summary type="text">A humorous account of life in the fictional small town of Mariposa.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/stephen-leacock">Stephen Leacock’s</a> humourous and affectionate account of small-town life in the fictional town of Mariposa. Written in 1912, it is drawn from his experiences living in Orillia, Ontario.</p>
			<p>The book is a series of funny and satirical anecdotes that illustrate the inner workings of life in Mariposa—from business to politics to steamboat disasters. The town is populated by many archetypal characters including the shrewd businessman <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith, the lovelorn bank teller <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pupkin, and the mathematically challenged <abbr>Rev. Mr.</abbr> Drone.</p>
			<p>During his lifetime, Stephen Leacock was very popular in much of the English-speaking world as a writer and humourist. <i>Sunshine Sketches</i> is considered one of his most notable and enduring works. In Canada, the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour is named in his honour. The medal is an annual award for the best Canadian book of literary humour published in the previous year.</p>

		<summary type="text">A father and son duo investigate a man who is wielding ancient Egyptian magic.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Perhaps best known for creating the character <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sax-rohmer/the-insidious-dr-fu-manchu">Fu-Manchu</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sax-rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a> is also known for his works involving the supernatural. This novel follows Robert Cairn, his father, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bruce Cairn, and their suspicion of one Antony Ferrara.</p>
			<p>After witnessing the strange and violent death of a swan, Robert Cairn suspects that Ferrara may be involved with the death of the bird. Soon after two murders, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bruce Cairn arrives in London and warns Robert that he suspects Ferrara is using ancient Egyptian magic to accomplish his evil deeds. After a mystical attack on Robert, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Cairn and his son become involved in a series of supernatural events as they work to prevent Antony Ferrara from inflicting his dark magic on more victims.</p>
			<p>Like many of his works, Rohmer includes exotic locations in this novel; first set in London, the action soon moves to the pyramids of Egypt as the father and son duo track down Ferrara. Having received both success and notoriety from Fu-Manchu, Rohmer has been given praise for <i>Brood of the Witch-Queen</i>, such as when <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a> favorably compared it to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker">Bram Stoker’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker/dracula"><i>Dracula</i></a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">Seven fable-like tales about jungle animals in India and the humans who live on the edges of their realm.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Jungle Book</i> is a short collection of stories published by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling">Kipling</a> in various magazines between 1893 and 1894. Kipling spent both his early years and his late teenage years in India, and that upbringing is front and center in these stories—despite them being written while he was living in Vermont, in the United States.</p>
			<p>The stories are fable-like, with most of them centering on the lives of anthropomorphised jungle animals and a few focused on human characters in India. The stories were popular from the start, and have since been adapted in countless ways in print, screen, and other media.</p>

		<summary type="text">The collected plays of Roswitha of Gandersheim, the tenth century German canoness, dramatist, and poet.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/roswitha-of-gandersheim">Roswitha</a>, also known as Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, was a tenth century German canoness, dramatist, and poet. A remarkable woman, she has been called the first Western playwright since antiquity as well as the first known woman playwright. She was inspired by the Roman comic playwright Terence, who wrote six farces filled with disguises, misunderstandings, and pagan debauchery. Upset by Terence’s immoral subject matter but also inspired by his well-crafted plays, Roswitha sought to “Christianize” his work by writing six plays of her own.</p>
			<p>Roswitha wrote six dramas in Latin. Two are concerned with the conversation of nonbelievers (<i>Gallicanus</i> and <i>Callimachus</i>), two are concerned with the repentance of sinners (<i>Abraham</i> and <i>Paphnutius</i>), and two are concerned with the martyrdom of virgins (<i>Dulcitus</i> and <i>Sapientia</i>).</p>
			<p>This edition, originally published in 1923, includes an introduction by Cardinal Francis Aidan Gasquet (an English Benedictine monk and scholar), a critical preface by the translator (Christopher <abbr>St.</abbr> John), and prefaces written by Roswitha herself.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of poems about the Klondike Gold Rush.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Songs of a Sourdough</i> is a collection of poems written in 1907 by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-w-service">Robert <abbr>W.</abbr> Service</a> while he was working as a bank teller in Whitehorse, Yukon. The best-known poems are those describing life during the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s, especially his ballads “The Shooting of Dan McGrew” and the “Cremation of Sam McGee.”</p>
			<p>While some of Service’s work had previously appeared in newspapers and periodicals, <i>Songs of a Sourdough</i> was his first book. Publishers initially questioned the “moral tone” of the work with its bawdy poems depicting not just the hard lives and isolation of Yukon prospectors but also the drinking, gambling, and prostitution that was prevalent in Dawson City. However, despite these reservations, the book was an immediate success. In Canada, there were ten printings and more than 12,000 copies sold in the first year alone. Dozens of additional printings followed in subsequent years, including editions issued in Britain and the United States.</p>

		<summary type="text">Adventure hero Buck Rogers battles the forces of the evil Han Empire in 2419 America.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Armageddon 2419 <abbr>A.D.</abbr></i> features the introduction of Buck Rogers, the famous sci-fi adventure hero of early comics and radio shows. Originally published in <i>Amazing Stories</i> in 1928, this novella was later combined with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/philip-francis-nowlan">Nowlan’s</a> sequel, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/philip-francis-nowlan/the-airlords-of-han"><i>The Airlords of Han</i></a>, and re-published under this same title in the 1960s.</p>
			<p>In it we follow Buck Rogers and his mysterious transportation to far-future America. The land was conquered by the evil Han Empire centuries ago, and the local Americans, scattered into competing gangs, are now starting a rebellion. Buck meets the leaders of one of the gangs and is swept up in the events.</p>

		<summary type="text">A phrasebook of unintentionally hilarious English.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1855 <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/pedro-carolino_jose-da-fonseca">Pedro Carolino</a> set out to write an English phrasebook for Portuguese travelers visiting England. The only problem was that he couldn’t speak English. Undeterred by this minor setback, Carolino decided to base his guide on a respected Portuguese–French phrasebook written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/pedro-carolino_jose-da-fonseca">José da Fonseca</a>. He took the French translations of Portuguese, and used a French–English dictionary to translate <em>those</em> to English.</p>
			<p>The result was an unintentional comedy of literal translation, as English phrases like “the walls have ears” became “the walls have hearsay” (via the Portuguese <i>as paredes têm ouvidos</i>), and “waiting for someone to open the door” became “to craunch the marmoset” (via a ridiculous misreading of archaic English, and the shape of the grotesque door knockers popular at the time).</p>
			<p>The entire guide was quite large, and not only was it of no practical use as an actual phrasebook, but its length made it too much of a slog to appeal as a comedy. But its legend slowly grew, until in 1883 it was republished in an abridged form as a book of humor titled <i>English as She Is Spoke</i> (a phrase which, incidentally, doesn’t appear in the book itself). The abridged edition, taking the comedic highlights from the long and tedious original, is the edition that became famous. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on that abridgment.</p>
			<p>The book’s absurd mistranslations were said to have made Lincoln laugh aloud when read to him by his secretary John Hay, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Mark Twain</a> said that “nobody can add to the absurdity of this book, nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect.”</p>

		<summary type="text">American archetype and cultural founding father P. T. Barnum shares a collection of anecdotes that he deems “humbugs”—fodder for the gullible, deserving of skepticism—with the goal of making his fellow citizens a little wiser and more skeptical.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“Humbug … I won’t believe it,” is Scrooge’s response when confronted by the ghost of his dead partner Jacob Marley in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></a>, and just as surely as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Dickens</a> knows that ghosts are humbugs, so too does <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-t-barnum">P. T. Barnum</a>, writing a generation later. For Barnum, humbug begins in the Garden of Eden with the temptation of Eve, and permeates all of history, through every age and in every nation, right down to his own time, where the “Great Spirit Postmaster” publishes ghost letters from veterans recently perished in the Civil War.</p>
			<p>Barnum himself was often called the “Prince of Humbugs,” but he was no cynic. In this book he sets out to make his fellow citizens a little wiser via a catalog of colorful characters and events, and mocking commentaries about how a sensible person should be more skeptical. He goes after all kinds of classic humbugs like ghosts, witches, and spiritualists, but he also calls humbug on shady investment schemes, hoaxes, swindlers, guerrilla marketers, and political dirty tricksters, before shining a light on the patent medicines of his day, impure foods, and adulterated drinks. As a raconteur, Barnum is conversational and avuncular, sharing the wisdom of his years and opening an intimate window into the New England of the mid-19th century.</p>

		<summary type="text">A comedy skewering Victorian high society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde’s</a> most popular play today, enduring thanks to its easy humor, witty dialog, and clever satire. It was also one of his more successful plays, despite its first run being prematurely ended after only 86 performances. The main characters pretend to be other people in order to escape social obligations, with the resulting confusion of identities driving the plot and the humor behind it.</p>
			<p><i>Earnest</i> also holds the sad distinction of being Wilde’s last published play. A feud with an aristocrat whose son was Wilde’s lover led to a court case revealing Wilde as a homosexual—a crime in those days, and punishable by imprisonment with hard labor.</p>

		<summary type="text">An autobiography of an ex-slave in the mid 1700s.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the mid 1700s, around the age of eleven, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/olaudah-equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a> and his sister were kidnapped from their village in equatorial Africa and sold to slavers. Within a year he was aboard a European slave ship on his way to the Caribbean. <i>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African</i> was published by the author in 1789 and is part adventure story, part treatise on the corrupting power of slavery, and part tract about the transformative powers of Christianity.</p>
			<p>Equiano’s story takes him from Africa to the Americas, back across the Atlantic to England, into the Mediterranean, and even north to the ice packs, on a mission to discover the North-East passage. He fights the French in the Seven Year’s War, is a mate and merchant in the West Indies, and eventually becomes a freedman based in London.</p>
			<p><i>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</i> was one of the first popular slave narratives and was reprinted eight times in the author’s lifetime. While modern scholars value this account as an important source on the life of the eighteenth-century slave and the transition from slavery to freedom, it remains an important literary work in its own right. As a valuable part of the African and African-American canons, it is still frequently taught in both English and History university courses.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Gogol’s translated short stories and novellas ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/nikolai-gogol">Nikolai Gogol</a> spent most of his literary career writing short stories, drawing inspiration from his childhood in Ukraine and his adult life in <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg. His stories are filled with larger than life yet relatable characters and perfectly described locations, and span many genres from historical epics to early horror and surrealism.</p>
			<p>His influence on Russian literature cannot be understated: <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> is quoted as saying “We all come out from Gogol’s ‘Overcoat,’ ” (presented here as “The Mantle”) and mentioned him by name in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky/crime-and-punishment/constance-garnett"><i>Crime and Punishment</i></a>; Mikhail Bulgakov stated that “no-one can compare with him,” and Vladimir Nabokov wrote a full biography. Many of the stories in this collection have been adapted for stage and film, including “The Nose” as an opera by Dmitri Shostakovich.</p>
			<p>Collected here are all of the public domain translations into English of Gogol’s short stories, in chronological order of the original Russian publication. They were translated by Claud Field, Isabel <abbr>F.</abbr> Hapgood, Vizetelly and Company, and George Tolstoy.</p>

		<summary type="text">A woman in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony is forced to wear the shame of her sin embroidered on her clothes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Scarlet Letter</i> was published in 1850; it was one of the first books to be mass-produced in America, which helped ensure its immediate popularity and ubiquitous presence on contemporary shelves. Its first printing of 2,500 books sold out in ten days.</p>
			<p>The novel is set in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony between the years 1642 and 1649. Hester Prynne has had a child out of wedlock, and its father is a mystery. For her sin, she is made to wear an embroidered scarlet A on her clothes—for “Adulteress.” She now faces a life of unending shame in the stern and religious Puritan colony, in a part of the world where there are no others to turn to.</p>
			<p>While the plot is simple, the novel is highly allegorical. It explores themes of sin, guilt, repentance, forgiveness, alienation, and legalism. Characters have symbolic names and appearances, and many aspects of the narrative can be viewed in a symbolist lens.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/nathaniel-hawthorne">Hawthorne</a> initially thought the novel was too short for publication on its own; to pad the length, he included the “Customhouse” introduction. The introduction angered the residents of Salem, who thought the introduction was poking mean-spirited fun at them. This prompted Hawthorne to republish the book “without the change of a word,” but with a reassurance that the introduction was meant in good spirits.</p>
			<p>The novel has been consistently popular since its publication, with it being required reading in many American high schools. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> called it “a perfect work of American imagination.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A father announces his daughter will marry Tartuffe, a sanctimonious fraud and hypocrite.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The first three acts of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/moliere">Molière’s</a> <i>Tartuffe</i> were first performed for Louis XIV in 1664, but the play was almost immediately suppressed—not because the King disliked it, but because the church resented the insinuation that the pious were frauds. After several different versions were written and performed privately, <i>Tartuffe</i> was eventually published in its final five-act form in 1669.</p>
			<p>A comic tale of man taken in by a sanctimonious scoundrel, the characters of Tartuffe, Elmire, and Orgon are considered among some of the great classical theater roles. As the family strives to convince the patriarch that Tartuffe is a religious fraud, the play ultimately focuses on skewering not the hypocrite, but his victims, and the hypocrisy of fervent religious belief unchecked by facts or reason—a defense Molière himself used to overcome the church’s proscriptions. In the end, the play was so impactful that both French and English now use the word “Tartuffe” to refer to a religious hypocrite who feigns virtue.</p>
			<p>In its original French, the play is written in twelve-syllable lines of rhyming couplets. Curtis Hidden Page’s translation invokes a popular compromise and renders it into the familiar blank verse without rhymed endings that was popularized by Shakespeare. The translation is considered a seminal by modern translators.</p>

		<summary type="text">The gentleman-thief returns only to face his most dangerous opponent yet.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> disappeared at the end of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc/the-hollow-needle/alexander-teixeira-de-mattos"><i>The Hollow Needle</i></a> the public and police assumed he was dead; but it turns out he was just biding his time and waiting for the right opponent to face off against. Luckily, a secret involving a stash of hidden papers and Europe’s aristocratic families is more than enough to pique the interests of Lupin and his unknown competitor. This novel is told more from Lupin’s point of view than the previous stories, and that reduces some of the omnipotence bestowed upon him by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Leblanc</a> while highlighting his more emotional qualities.</p>
			<p>Originally serialized in <i>Le Journal</i>, <i>813</i> was published in novel form in 1910. At more than 500 pages, it was deemed a little heavy and was subsequently split into two volumes in 1917 along with slight editing to increase the timely anti-German sentiment. Presented here is the 1910 English translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">The self-told story of the black man who accompanied Robert Peary during the first trip to the North Pole.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Robert Peary’s team was the first to reach the North Pole, he was the only white man in the picture. Accompanying him were four Eskimos and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/matthew-henson">Matthew Henson</a>, a black man who had been with Peary on all his expeditions for the previous twenty years. Henson tells the story of that last expedition with candor and warmth, making neither too much nor too little of the conditions the team endured, including travelling on foot and sled in temperatures reaching 50° and more below zero. Henson’s story is a testament to fortitude in the face of debilitating conditions.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of reminiscences and reflections from the author’s experiences.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Autobiography of Mark Twain</i> is a collection of reminiscences and reflections. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Twain</a> began dictating them in 1870, and in 1906 he published <i>Chapters from My Autobiography</i> in twenty-five installments in the <i>North American Review</i>. He continued to write stories for his autobiography, most of which weren’t published in his lifetime due to a lack of access to his papers, or their private subject matters. After Twain’s death, numerous editors have tried to organize this collection of published and unpublished autobiographical works, producing various differing editions. The most recent attempt is by the Mark Twain Project at the University of California, Berkeley, which published a three-volume edition; but, through what many consider legal trickery, the University of California, Berkeley has claimed copyright on that edition until 2047—137 years after Twain’s death.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on Harper and Brothers’ 1924 collection, compiled by Albert Bigelow Paine.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young boy growing up in Missouri gets into all sorts of trouble and, with his friend, stumbles on a treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The irrepressible Tom Sawyer drives his Aunt Polly to distraction; she can’t decide whether to cry or laugh at his antics. He fights, falls in love, and finds adventure with two of his friends, one of whom will later become famous in his own right. Along the way he attends his own funeral, wins the girl by falsely confessing to something she did, and, most famously, convinces most of the boys in town to pay him for the privilege of painting his aunt’s fence.</p>
			<p><i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Mark Twain’s</a> first novel written solely by himself. Although he was already a well-known author, it was for autobiographical sketches (<i>The Innocents Abroad</i>) and novels written with others (<i>The Gilded Age</i>). In writing about Tom, Twain drew on his childhood growing up in Hannibal, Missouri, infusing the story with his usual biting satire and social commentary. In Tom Sawyer and his friends, Twain created young men who would long outlive him. Not without controversy over the years due to its language and negative depiction of a Native American, <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is arguably Twain’s most endearing, and enduring, work.</p>

		<summary type="text">One of the most important texts of 20th century philosophy, in which the nature of the philosphy, language, understanding, and logical atomism are explored.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ludwig-wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> is considered by many to be one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. He was born in Vienna to an incredibly rich family, but he gave away his inheritance and spent his life alternating between academia and various other roles, including serving as an officer during World War I and a hospital porter during World War II. When in academia Wittgenstein was taught by Bertrand Russell, and he himself taught at Cambridge.</p>
			<p>He began laying the groundwork for <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> while in the trenches, and published it after the end of the war. It has since come to be considered one of the most important works of 20th century philosophy. After publishing it, Wittgenstein concluded that it had solved all philosophical problems—so he never published another book-length work in his lifetime.</p>
			<p>The book itself is divided into a series of short, self-evident statements, followed by sub-statements elucidating on their parent statement, sub-sub-statements, and so on. These statements explore the nature of philosophy, our understanding of the world around us, and how language fits in to it all. These views later came to be known as “Logical Atomism.”</p>
			<p>This translation, while credited to <abbr>C. K.</abbr> Ogden, is actually mostly the work of <abbr>F. P.</abbr> Ramsey, one of Ogden’s students. Ramsey completed the translation when he was just 19 years of age. The translation was personally revised and approved by Wittgenstein himself, who, though he was Austrian, had spent much of his life in England.</p>
			<p>Much of the <i>Tractatus</i>’ meaning is complex and difficult to unpack. It is still being interpreted and explored to this day.</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of how four young sisters grow to adulthood.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Little Women</i> is the classic coming-of-age tale of four sisters on their journey to adulthood. Though today it’s considered a classic, <i>Little Women</i> almost wasn’t written: <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/louisa-may-alcott">Alcott</a> wanted to publish a collection of short stories instead, but her publisher and her father pressed her to write a book that would appeal to a wide audience of young girls.</p>
			<p>The first volume was written quickly and published in 1868; it was a huge success, and Alcott composed the second volume just as quickly and published it in 1869. By her own account she didn’t enjoy writing them, and both she and her publisher agreed the first few chapters were dull—so it almost goes without saying she was pleasantly shocked at the positive reception the volumes received.</p>
			<p>By 1927 it had been acknowledged as one of the most widely-read novels of the era, and remains widely read today.</p>

		<summary type="text">The autobiography of a woman who grew up in, and escaped from, slavery.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Harriet Jacobs was born a slave in North Carolina, but, in her words, didn’t realize it until her father died when she was six years old. Six years later, when her mistress died, she was bequeathed to the mistress’ granddaughter, thereby coming into the household of the mistress’ lecherous son. Several years later she escaped, only to have to hide for seven years in a cramped garret that did not allow her to stand or sit up. She was finally able to make her way north, where she was reunited with her children. Many years later, after narrowly avoiding capture multiple times due to the Fugitive Slave Law, her employer purchased her freedom.</p>
			<p>Jacobs, writing as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/linda-brent">Linda Brent</a>, tells the riveting story of her life in the South as a slave. She brings an unflinching eye to “good” masters and mistresses who nevertheless lie to, steal from, and continually break promises to their slaves, and to bad masters who beat and kill their slaves for no particular reason. Even in the North, after her escape, she is disappointed to find prejudice and degrading treatment for blacks. After having been convinced to write down her story, it took years to find a publisher who would print it. It was finally made available to the public just a few months before the shots at Fort Sumter that began the Civil War.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young Jewish man’s family is falsely imprisoned and he is sent to the galleys; when he is released, he swears revenge on the Romans.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Judah and Massala are close friends growing up, though one is Jewish and the other Roman. But when an accident happens after Massala returns from five years in Rome, Massala betrays his childhood friend and family. Judah’s mother and sister are taken away to prison, and he is sent to a galley-ship. Years later, Judah rescues a ship’s captain from drowning after a ship-to-ship battle, and the tribune adopts him in gratitude. Judah then devotes himself to learning as much as he can about being a warrior, in the hopes of leading an insurrection against Rome. He thinks he’s found the perfect leader in a young Nazarite, but is disappointed at the young man’s seeming lack of ambition.</p>
			<p>Before writing <i>Ben-Hur</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lew-wallace">Lew Wallace</a> was best known for being a Major General in the American Civil War. After the war, a conversation with an atheist caused Wallace to take stock of how little he knew about his own religion. He launched into what would be years of research so that he could write with accuracy about first-century Israel. Although Judah Ben-Hur is the novel’s main character, the book’s subtitle, “A Tale of the Christ,” reveals Wallace’s real focus. Sales were only a trickle at the beginning, but it soon became a bestseller, and went on to become the best-selling novel of the nineteenth century. It has never been out of print, and to date has inspired two plays, a TV series, and five films—one of which, the 1959 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer epic, is considered to be one of the best films yet made.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Leonid Andreyev’s translated short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leonid-andreyev">Leonid Andreyev</a> was a Russian playwright and author of short stories and novellas, writing primarily in the first two decades of the 20th century. Matching the depression he suffered from an early age, his writing is always dark of tone with subjects including biblical parables, Russian life, eldritch horror and revolutionary fervour. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a> was a reader of his work, and <i>The Seven Who Were Hanged</i> (included here) has even been cited as direct inspiration for the assassination of Arch-Duke Ferdinand: the event that started the first World War. Originally a lawyer, his first published short story brought him to the attention of Maxim Gorky who not only became a firm friend but also championed Andreyev’s writing in his collections to great commercial acclaim.</p>
			<p>Widely translated into English during his life, this collection comprises the best individual translations of each of his short stories and novellas available in the public domain, presented in chronological order of their original publication in Russian.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man describes his birth and upbringing through the adventures of his family.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</i>, a fictional autobiography of the eponymous narrator, contains—perhaps surprisingly—little about either his life or opinions, but what it does have is a meandering journey through the adventures of his close family and their associates. The book is famous for being more about the explanatory diversions and rabbit-holes that the narrator takes us down than the actual happenings he set out to describe, but in doing so he paints a vivid picture of the players and their personal stories.</p>
			<p>Published two volumes at a time over the course of eight years, <i>Tristram Shandy</i> was an immediate commercial success although not without some confusion among critics. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/laurence-sterne">Sterne’s</a> exploration of form that pushed at the contemporary limits of what could be called a novel has been hugely influential, garnering admirers as varied as Marx, Schopenhauer, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">Joyce</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf">Woolf</a> and Rushdie. The book has been translated into many other languages and adapted for the stage, radio, and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">One of the fundamental texts of the Tao philosophy and religion.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is a classic Chinese text written around the 6th century <abbr>BC</abbr> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/laozi">Laozi</a>, a Zhou-dynasty courtier. While its authorship is debated, the text remains a fundamental building block of Taoism and one of the most influential works of its time. Today it’s one of the most-translated works in the world.</p>
			<p>The work itself is a series of 81 short poetic sections, each one written in a fluid, ambiguous style, leaving them open to wide interpretation. Subjects range from advice to those in power to advice to regular people and adages for daily living. Because of its ambiguous nature the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is famously difficult to translate, and many, if not all, translations are significantly influenced by the translator’s state of mind. This translation is by James Legge, a famous Scottish sinologist and the first professor of Chinese at Oxford University.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of a young farm girl named Dorothy in the magical Land of Oz, after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their Kansas home by a cyclone.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> is the classic American children’s novel about the adventures of Dorothy, a young girl who along with her dog Toto is swept away by a cyclone to the magical Land of Oz. It was written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-frank-baum"><abbr>L.</abbr> Frank Baum</a> and published in May 1900.</p>
			<p>Dorothy lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and Toto on a farm in the Kansas prairie. One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a cyclone that deposits her farmhouse into Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins. The Good Witch of the North arrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magical Silver Shoes that once belonged to the Wicked Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home is to go to the Emerald City and ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her.</p>
			<p>The Library of Congress has declared it “America’s greatest and best-loved homegrown fairy-tale.” Its groundbreaking success and the success of the Broadway musical adaptation led Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books which serve as sequels to the first story. The 1939 film musical adaptation starring Judy Garland is considered by many to be one of the greatest films in cinema history.</p>

		<summary type="text">A boy named Tip embarks on adventures in the magical land of Oz after he runs away from a witch.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Four years after writing his immensely popular <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-frank-baum/the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz"><i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i></a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-frank-baum"><abbr>L.</abbr> Frank Baum</a> returned to the Land of Oz in this second book of fourteen he wrote about the magical country.

			<p>A young boy named Tip lives in Gillikin Country in Oz with an old witch named Mombi. When Mombi threatens to turn Tip into a statue, he escapes with his friend Jack, a wooden man with a pumpkin for a head who has been brought to life through magic. He then journeys to the Emerald City, where he embarks upon an exciting adventure, meeting new quirky characters and returning favorites from the first book.</p>

		<summary type="text">The development of artificial beings in huge quantities to act as workers and soldiers leads to disaster for mankind.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i><abbr>R.U.R.</abbr>, or Rossum’s Universal Robots</i> is a play written in 1920 by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karel-capek">Karel Čapek</a>, a Czech writer who wrote many plays and novels, many of them with science-fiction and dystopian themes. <i><abbr>R.U.R.</abbr></i> is perhaps the most well-known of these works in the English-speaking world because it brought the word “robot” into the language. “Robot” is derived from the Czech word meaning “worker.”</p>
			<p>The play is set in the island headquarters of the <abbr>R.U.R.</abbr> corporation. The corporation has been manufacturing artificial beings which resemble humans, but who are tireless workers. They can be mass-produced in large numbers and are being adopted as workers in many countries. In the first scene of the play, they are visited by a young woman, Helena Glory, who aspires to relieve the lot of the robots, who she sees as oppressed. However, in what must be the fastest seduction scene in all drama, she is wooed and agrees to marry Harry Domin, the factory manager, who she has just met. She still however aspires to improve the life of robots and find a way to give them souls. Ultimately, however, this admirable desire leads to disaster for humankind.</p>
			<p>The play was translated into English, and slightly abridged, by Paul Selver and Nigel Playfair in 1923. This version quickly became popular with both British and American audiences and was well received by critics.</p>

		<summary type="text">Five Americans, balloon-wrecked on a deserted island, must find a way to survive while revealing the island’s strange mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Mysterious Island</i> tells the tale of five Americans who, in an attempt to escape the Civil War, pilot a hot-air balloon and find themselves crashed on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne">Verne</a> had been greatly influenced by works like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></a> and <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, and that influence shines brightly in this novel of engineering ingenuity and adventure. Verne imparts the escapees with such over-the-top cleverness and so many luckily-placed resources that modern readers might find the extent to which they tame the island comical. Despite that, the island contains genuine mysteries for the adventurers to solve.</p>
			<p>The standard translation of <i>The Mysterious Island</i> was produced in 1875, and is credited to <abbr>W. H. G.</abbr> Kingston. Despite its popularity, it’s widely criticized for abridging and Bowlderizing important parts of the text. The translation presented here, produced by Stephen <abbr>W.</abbr> White in 1876, is considered a much more accurate translation, despite it also abridging some portions.</p>

		<summary type="text">The fictitious South American republic of Costaguana is in the midst of a civil war and the citizens of the coastal town of Sulaco turn to Nostromo for help.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Originally published as a serial, <i>Nostromo</i> is set in a fictional South American country where the outbreak of civil war puts the mining town of Sulaco in turmoil. Giovanni Battista Fidanza, known as Nostromo, is given the task of smuggling out a large amount of silver to keep it from the revolutionaries.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-conrad">Conrad</a> was inspired to write the book when he read, in a sailor’s memoir, the tale of a man who singlehandedly stole a boatload of silver. He had first heard the same story a quarter of a century earlier as a young sailor.</p>
			<p><i>Nostromo</i> has met with critical acclaim: it is often regarded as Conrad’s greatest novel and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald">Francis Scott Fitzgerald</a> said he would rather have written <i>Nostromo</i> than any other novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three scientists from Earth invent space travel and meet extraterrestrial life, but then must defend the solar system from a new threat.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the year 2126, scientists Arcot and Morey chase a sky pirate—and invent the technology to travel through space. In the second story, the heroes travel to Venus and make first contact with an alien species. Finally, they must defend the solar system from invaders whose own star has long since gone dark.</p>
			<p>Originally published separately as “Piracy Preferred” in <i>Amazing Stories</i> June 1930 edition, “Solarite” in <i>Amazing Stories</i> November 1930, and “The Black Star Passes” in <i>Amazing Stories Quarterly</i> Fall 1930, these three novellas were edited and collected into this volume in 1953.</p>
			<p>This is the first book in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-w-campbell">John W. Campbell’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arcot-morey-and-wade">Arcot, Morey, and Wade</a> trilogy. Most famous for editing <i>Astounding Science Fiction and Fact</i> magazine and introducing Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, and many other great science fiction authors to the world, Campbell’s other notable works include the novella “Who Goes There?”, which was adapted to film as <i>The Thing</i> by John Carpenter in 1982.</p>

		<summary type="text">Journalist John Reed gives a first-hand account of Russia’s 1917 October Revolution, which lead to the formation of the Soviet Union.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1917 <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-reed">John Reed</a>, a journalist and socialist, witnessed first-hand the 1917 Russian October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks seized power and began forming the Soviet Union. <i>Ten Days that Shook the World</i> is his account of the revolution, including on-the-ground descriptions of the days up to those portentious events.</p>
			<p>The book received a mixed reception. Some reviewers found it a powerful account of the events, one of the few available in English. Others noted Reed’s bias as an established Socialist writer. In any case, the book was hugely influential: this edition boasts a preface by Lenin, John Reed was buried in Moscow in a site reserved for Soviet leadership, and some Soviet couples even went so far as to name their children “Johnreed.” In 1999 New York University placed <i>Ten Days that Shook the World</i> 7th in their “Top 100 Works of Journalism” list.</p>

		<summary type="text">Jane Addams’ autobiographical account of the founding and operation of Hull House, one of America’s most famous settlement homes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-addams">Jane Addams</a> was a famous social activist living in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century. She’s perhaps most famous for introducing the Settlement movement to the United States and for founding Hull House, a hugely influential settlement house in Chicago.</p>
			<p>Settlement houses were founded on the idea of uplifting the poor working class by quartering the rich and poor together in close proximity. By living together under the guidance of settlement workers, the poor would have access to communal education, healthcare, day care, food, and shelter, allowing them to improve their positions in society instead of being ground under heel by the privations of poverty and the brutality of workhouses. Immigrants in particular could take advantage of the settlement’s safety net, helping them naturalize more easily in their new country as they struggled to find stability while both working and raising children.</p>
			<p>Hull House, named after the house’s original owner, was Addams’ life work. It brought together the urban poor—mostly recently-settled immigrants—together into a vast thirteen-building complex near the heart of Chicago’s downtown. In this book Addams describes the house, its founding, and its operations; because running the house was such a major part of her life, she considered this book to be her autobiography of sorts. Hull House remained open until 2012, operating continuously for over 120 years.</p>
			<p>For her work at Hull House and for her involvement in the Peace Movement of World War I, Addams was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the award’s first American woman recipient. At the time of her death she was the most well-known female public figure in America.</p>

		<summary type="text">The lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur in the life of an author of fantasy books.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Cream of the Jest</i> is a later entry in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-branch-cabell">James Branch Cabell’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/biography-of-the-life-of-manuel">Dom Manuel</a> series. The series as a whole is a fantasy series, and this entry takes a philosophical turn: after the first few chapters of standard high-fantasy fare, the narrative pulls out to reveal the point of view of the narrative’s author, Felix Kennaston.</p>
			<p>Kennaston life slowly starts to blur with his fantasy world. He finds himself constantly dreaming of Etarre, a mysterious, Beatrice-like figure; but every time he tries to touch her, he wakes up. Soon his neglected wife begins to blur in to Etarre, and his increasingly-philosophical dream worlds begin to become less distinguishable from his day-to-day life.</p>
			<p>Though <i>The Cream of the Jest</i> is a kind of capstone to a larger fantasy series, the book itself feels more like philosophy than fantasy. Kennaston’s journeys through his dream worlds explore a series of thoughtful threads, from the interface of thought and reality, to the power of religion, to the human condition.</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of a domesticated dog’s return to a primitive state in the late 19th-century Yukon.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london">Jack London</a> spent nearly a year in Alaska and the Klondike, mining for gold and braving the Alaskan winter. There he was inspired to write what would become <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, one of his most famous novels. <i>The Call of the Wild</i> tells the tale of a domesticated dog stolen from his California family and sold to sledders in Alaska. As he adapts to the harsh and wild environment, he slowly sheds domestication and returns to his primal roots.</p>
			<p><i>The Call of the Wild</i> was London’s first major success, ensuring he’d have a readership for his future writing and paving the way for him to become one of the first writers to amass a fortune from just his fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Ivan Bunin’s translated short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ivan-bunin">Ivan Bunin</a> was a Russian author, poet and diarist, who in 1933 (at the age of 63) won the Nobel Prize in Literature “for the strict artistry with which he has carried on the classical Russian traditions in prose writing.” Viewed by many at the time as the heir to his friend and contemporary <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov</a>, Bunin wrote his poems and stories with a depth of description that attracted the admiration of his fellow authors. Maxim Gorky described him as “the best Russian writer of the day” and “the first poet of our times,” and his translators include <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence"><abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence</a> and Leonard Woolf.</p>
			<p>This collection includes the famous <i>The Gentleman from San Francisco</i>, partially set on Capri where Bunin spent several winters, and stories told from the point of view of many more characters, including historic Indian princes, emancipated Russian serfs, desert prophets, and even a sea-faring dog. The short stories collected here are all of the available public domain translations into English, in chronological order of the original Russian publication. They were translated by <abbr>S. S.</abbr> Koteliansky, <abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence, Leonard Woolf, Bernard Guilbert Guerney, and <i>The Russian Review</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man tries to climb up the cutthroat Parisian social ladder during the Bourbon Restoration.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Father Goriot</i>, today considered one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/honore-de-balzac">Balzac’s</a> most important works, is part of his novel sequence <i>The Human Comedy</i>. It’s the first of Balzac’s novels to feature recurring characters, a technique that he famously developed in his subsequent novels.</p>
			<p>Set in Paris during the Bourbon Restoration of the early 1800s, <i>Father Goriot</i> follows Eugène de Rastignac, a student born to noble roots but little means, as he tries to climb the social ladder in Paris. The impoverished Goriot is staying at the same boardinghouse as Rastignac—and Rastignac sees opportunity in Goriot’s richly-married and elegant daughters.</p>
			<p>The novel has been widely praised for its realist portrayal of Parisian life of various social classes, and its deep influence on French literature is still felt today. While it had chapter breaks when it was initially serialized, Balzac removed them when compiling his definitive edition of <i>The Human Comedy</i>, a change that is preserved in this edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">An epic poem following a Greek hero trying to return home after the Trojan war.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Odyssey</i> is one of the oldest works of Western literature, dating back to classical antiquity. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer">Homer’s</a> epic poem belongs in a collection called the Epic Cycle, which includes the <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-iliad/william-cullen-bryant">Iliad</a></i>. It was originally written in ancient Greek, utilizing a dactylic hexameter rhyme scheme. Although this rhyme scheme sounds beautiful in its native language, in modern English it can sound awkward and, as Eric McMillan humorously describes it, resembles “pumpkins rolling on a barn floor.” William Cullen Bryant avoided this problem by composing his translation in blank verse, a rhyme scheme that sounds natural in English.</p>
			<p>This epic poem follows Ulysses, one of the Greek leaders that brought an end to the ten-year-long Trojan war. Longing for home, he travels across the Mediterranean Sea to return to his kingdom in Ithaca; unfortunately, our hero manages to anger Neptune, the god of the sea, making his trip home agonizingly slow and extremely dangerous. While Ulysses is trying to return home, his family in Ithaca is also in danger. Suitors have traveled to the home of Ulysses to marry his wife, Penelope, believing that her husband did not survive the war. These men are willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.</p>

Chryseis’ father, the city’s priest, prays to the god Apollo and asks for a plague on the Achaean army. To stop this plague, Agamemnon returns Chryseis to her father, but then orders Achilles to give him Briseis as compensation. Achilles refuses.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Henry David Thoreau’s essays.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Though perhaps most famous for <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-david-thoreau/walden">Walden</a></i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-david-thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> was also a prolific essayist. Many of his essays touch on subjects similar to his famous book: long walks through nature, things found in moonlight that are invisible and unheard during the day, his preference for wild apples over domestic ones. In many ways he prefigured environmentalism, expressing his love for untouched nature and lamenting what the encroachment of man and cities were doing to it.</p>
			<p>He also had strong opinions on many other subjects. One of his most famous essays, “On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,” was written as a result of his going to jail for refusing to pay several years’ worth of poll taxes. One of the primary reasons for his refusal was his holding the government in contempt for its support of slavery, and several of his other essays express support and admiration for John Brown, who thought to start a slave revolt when he attacked Harper’s Ferry in 1859.</p>
			<p>Whether discussing trees in a forest, slavery, or the works of Thomas Carlyle, Thoreau’s essays are deeply personal and full of keen observations, often in poetic language. They give a sense of the man expressing them as being much more than the views being expressed.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Norwegian sea captain’s widow who, no matter how much she tries, cannot escape the ghosts of the past.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written in 1881, when melodrama and farce were still at their peak of popularity, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henrik-ibsen">Ibsen’s</a> <i>Ghosts</i> is a three-act tragedy that explores uncomfortable, even forbidden themes. It is also a highly critical commentary on the morality of the day. The play centers around the widow of a prominent Norwegian sea captain whose son returns home and, with tragic consequences, revives the ghosts of the past that she has long labored to put to rest.</p>
			<p><i>Ghosts</i> immediately became a source of controversy for its inclusion of topics like venereal disease, incest, and euthanasia, and it was banned from being performed in England for many years. Its arrival signals a shift in the nature of theatre and, despite negative criticism, it was translated into other languages and performed in Sweden, Germany, and New York within a few years of its debut. It stands now as one of the works considered to have ushered in the era of modern drama.</p>

		<summary type="text">In 1870s Norway, a woman struggles to be herself within the confines of marriage and society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1870s Norway, Nora Helmer struggles to be her own person within her marriage and a society that limits the opportunities of women. When decisions made to protect her husband come back to haunt her, Nora must fight for her family and for her own place in the world.</p>
			<p>Since its first theatrical run, in which every performance was sold out, <i>A Doll’s House</i> has inspired admiration, controversy, and discussion. First published by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henrik-ibsen">Ibsen</a> in 1879 in Danish, the official language of Danish-ruled Norway, <i>A Doll’s House</i> sold out its first two printings within months. It first premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen within a month of publication, and the play was performed in Germany in 1880 and London in 1884.</p>
			<p>Initial translations changed the play, particularly the ending, to be more sympathetic and acceptable. Ibsen considered these changes to be a “barbaric outrage.” It wouldn’t be until 1889 that the play was performed as written in London and Broadway.</p>
			<p>Ibsen’s work pioneered realistic depictions of middle class families and social themes. He claimed that he didn’t have feminist intentions in the writing of <i>A Doll’s House</i>, instead aiming for “the description of humanity,” but the play is widely considered an essential feminist work and has had a real lasting impact: as recently as 2006, it was the most performed play in the world.</p>

		<summary type="text">An angel falls into the everyday world of 19th Century England and is bewildered and despirited by human life and society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Wonderful Visit</i> is an early work by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a>, published in the same year as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-time-machine"><i>The Time Machine</i></a>. It takes a gentle, semi-comic approach to some of Wells’ social concerns by using the device of an angel fallen into our world from the Land of Dreams. This external observer, largely ignorant of the ways of humans and our society, is able to focus an unbiased eye on our failings.</p>
			<p>The story opens with a strange glare over the little village of Sidderford one night, observed by only a few. But then reports arise of a Strange Bird being seen in the woods. The Rev. Hilyer, the Vicar of Sidderford, is a keen ornithologist. He takes his gun and goes out to hunt this unusual specimen for his collection. He does indeed see a strange flying creature, shoots at it, and brings it down. To his horror, he finds that he has shot and wounded a man-like creature with wings—in fact, an Angel.</p>
			<p>The Vicar restores the Angel to health, but finds himself incapable of convincing others that this person really is an angel. The continuing clashes of the Angel’s idealistic points of view with the harsh reality of the human world are the core of this story.</p>
			<p><i>The Wonderful Visit</i> was well-received by critics and Wells’ contemporaries. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> praised it for its imaginative approach in a personal letter to Wells.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young reporter gets caught up in intrigue and adventure chasing tallow-wax bounties with the monster hunters on Fenris, a planet with a two-thousand-hour day and four-day year.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Reminiscent of old whaling stories, <i>Four-Day Planet</i> follows the story of Walter Boyd, a scrappy 17-year-old reporter working for his father at the <i>Port Sandor Times</i>. Walt gets tied up in the adventures of the sea-monster hunters on Fenris—a barely-habitable planet with a 2,000-hour day. The prized—and only—commodity on Fenris is tallow-wax, a miraculous material harvested from the dangerous seas of the planet.</p>
			<p>While being set in a grand sci-fi universe, the book packs in more about intrigue, betrayal, and the grit required to survive on a backwater planet of the Federation. The book was later re-published as a “two-for-one” with <i>Lone Star Planet</i> (originally titled <i>A Planet for Texans</i>).</p>

		<summary type="text">Mr. Vane discovers another world inside his library and embarks on an allegorical journey.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lilith</i>, first published in 1895, tells the story of Mr. Vane, the owner of a library that seems to be haunted by a raven—the ghost of the library’s former owner. Mr. Vane eventually follows this strange figure through a mirror and into another world, the “region of seven dimensions.” There Vane meets a number of characters, including Biblical characters like Adam and his first wife Lilith. Thus begins a battle of good versus evil that reverberates through dimensions. The narrative is heavy with Christian allegory, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-macdonald">MacDonald</a> uses the world to expound on his Christian universalist philosophy while telling a story of life, death and ultimately salvation.</p>
			<p>Critics consider <i>Lilith</i> to be one of MacDonald’s darker works, but opinion on it is divided. Despite this, some critics praise it for its rich imagery, with scholar Neil Barron claiming that the novel is the “obvious parent of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/david-lindsay">David Lindsay’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/david-lindsay/a-voyage-to-arcturus">A Voyage to Arcturus</a></i>,” itself a highly influential work of fantasy.</p>

		<summary type="text">In the neighborhood of a rural English town in the 1830s, several men and women struggle with love, marriage and fortune.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“<a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-eliot">George Eliot</a>” was the pen-name of Mary Ann Evans, one of the greatest of English novelists of the Victorian era. Her long novel <i>Middlemarch</i>, subtitled <i>A Study of Provincial Life</i>, is generally considered to be her finest work.</p>
			<p>Published in eight installments between 1871 and 1872, <i>Middlemarch</i> tells the intertwined stories of a variety of people living in the vicinity of the (fictional) midlands town of Middlemarch during the early 1830s, the time of the great Reform Act. The novel is remarkable for its realistic treatment of situation, character and relationships and also demonstrates its author’s accurate knowledge of political issues, medicine, politics, and rural economy. Yet it also includes several touches of humor.</p>
			<p>The novel’s main characters include: Dorothea Brooke, a religiously-inclined and very intelligent young woman who marries a much older man believing that she can assist him in his scholarly studies; Dr. Tertius Lydgate, a doctor who comes to Middlemarch to further his medical research and implement his ideas for treatment, but whose plans are thrown into disarray by an unwise marriage; Fred Vincy, an idle young man, the son of the town’s Mayor, who gets into a mire of debt; and several others.</p>
			<p>The initial reception of the novel by critics was mixed, with a number of unfavorable reviews, but its reputation has grown through time and <i>Middlemarch</i> is now generally considered to be one of the best novels ever written in English.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Voltairine de Cleyre’s poetry.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltairine-de-cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a> was a prominent American feminist anarchist active during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
			<p>Despite (or, perhaps, because of) her childhood experience of being placed in a Catholic convent school, de Cleyre became a member of the anticlerical Freethought movement. Later, she became a member of the American anarchist movement after becoming outraged at the way defendants were sentenced at the 1886 Haymarket Affair trials. Influences on de Cleyre’s beliefs and writings included <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mary-wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> and her lover and fellow anarchist Dyer Lum. She also shared a respectful disagreement with her fellow feminist anarchist <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emma-goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, who eventually came to praise her as “the most gifted and brilliant anarchist woman America ever produced.”</p>
			<p>Prominent themes in de Cleyre’s poetry include the Haymarket Affair and its aftermath (e.g. “At the Grave in Waldheim”), anti-clericalism (e.g. “The Gods and the People”) and women’s liberation (e.g. “Betrayed”). While largely ignored during most of the 20th century, interest in de Cleyre and her poetry has revived during the late 20th century, thanks in part to Paul Avrich’s 1978 biography, <i>An American Anarchist: The Life of Voltairine de Cleyre</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">Mary Wollstonecraft’s account of her travels through Scandinavia.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In June 1795, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mary-wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> embarked on a three-month trip around Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, on undisclosed business at the request of her lover Gilbert Imlay. During the course of this voyage she wrote twenty-five letters to him, which were compiled the following year at the behest of her publisher into this volume. As a travelogue, the letters of course contain descriptions of the natural beauty of the places she visited and the habits and interests of the people she met; but what is more apparent is Mary’s growing realization that this journey she has undertaken for Imlay ultimately won’t heal their relationship.</p>
			<p><i>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</i> was the last work of Mary Wollstonecraft’s published during her lifetime; she died two years later, shortly after the birth of her second child, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mary-shelley">Mary Shelley</a>. It follows the themes of her earlier works: a belief in reason’s ability to elevate people, the injustice of society’s oppression of women, and a spreading idea that commercialism does more to deprave than to enlighten humankind.</p>

		<summary type="text">An escaped convict steals two candlesticks and uses the proceeds to redeem himself and become an honest man.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Les Misérables</i>, by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo">Victor Hugo</a> has been described as one of literature’s greatest novels. The first two volumes were published in French in March 1862 and translated into English later the same year. Since then it has been translated by numerous others and has been adapted for film, television, radio, animation and the stage.</p>
			<p>This epic novel tells the story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who is attempting to escape from his past. Newly released from the galley-ships, Jean Valjean steals the silverware from the bishop who has taken him in for the night. When he is captured, the bishop urges him to use the silver to become an honest citizen. Valjean becomes a wealthy man, owner of a factory and mayor of his town but his past is only a footstep away in the form of Javert, Inspector of Police, who recognises Valjean from his time as a guard.</p>
			<p>A factory-worker, who has been dismissed from Valjean’s employment, is sentenced to six months imprisonment but ends up dying in the town’s hospital and Valjean feels responsible for the downward spiral of her life, so rescues her child, Cosette, from the corrupt inn-keepers with whom her mother had left her.</p>
			<p>The rest of the novel tells the stories of Valjean, Cosette and other characters which intertwine with each other. Hugo also included a number of “digressions” on subjects including cloistered religious orders, the use of slang language and, most significantly, the battle of Waterloo.</p>
			<p>The book was highly anticipated in 1862, having been advertised from as early as 1860. Hugo did not allow the publishers to summarise the story in advance, surely because any summary could not do a novel of this length any justice.</p>

		<summary type="text">The world’s greatest showman tells the story of his life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Struggles and Triumphs</i> is the autobiography of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-t-barnum"><abbr>P. T.</abbr> Barnum</a>, the celebrated American showman. Though subtitled <i>Forty Years’ Recollections</i>, it covers a period of over 60 years, from his birth in 1810, to the later years of his career in the 1870s.</p>
			<p>Barnum has an engaging style, and his autobiography is crammed with many amusing and interesting incidents as he tells how he learned to make money entertaining the public through circuses, “freak shows,” theatrical presentations, concert tours and the like. On the way he builds up an impressive fortune, only to lose it all through a fraudulous speculation perpetrated on him. Then he starts again, pays off his debts and builds up another, greater fortune. Though often labelled as a “humbug” or “a mere charlatan” it’s clear that the majority of his contemporary Americans held him in affectionate regard.</p>
			<p>However modern readers may be upset by Barnum’s rather cavalier treatment of the animals under his care in the various menageries and aquariums he created, and be distressed by the details of how they were lost in the several fires which destroyed Barnum’s Museums.</p>
			<p>Also of great interest are Barnum’s philanthropic endeavours: lecturing on teetotalism; supporting negro equality; and funding civic developments.</p>

		<summary type="text">Jurgen, a pawnbroker and “monstrous clever fellow,” is sent on a witty and parodic magical journey in search of true love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Jurgen</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-branch-cabell">James Branch Cabell’s</a> most famous novel, and a highly influential one in the fantasy genre. The novel is a witty, parodic send-up of the ideal of courtly love. Soon after publication, its bawdy style and double-entendre-laden dialog brought it to the attention of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, who promptly attempted to prosecute it for obscenity. After some years Cabell finally won the trial, and the publicity the trial brought made the book and Cabell famous. In his revised 1922 edition (on which this ebook is based) Cabell satirizes the Society in his Foreword, where Jurgen is placed on trial by the Philistines, overseen by a giant dung beetle as prosecutor.</p>
			<p>The eponymous Jurgen is a pawnbroker and self-described “monstrous clever fellow” who, after passing by a demon and offering an offhand compliment, finds himself having regained his youth as he is launched on a magical, amorous journey. On his quest for love Jurgen meets a series of mythological and legendary characters—from Nessus the centaur, to Guinevere, to Helen of Troy, to the Lady of the Lake, and more. His wit charms all of them, though Jurgen never seems happy with whatever astonishing situation he finds himself in—whether it’s pestering the devils of hell or chatting with the creator in heaven.</p>
			<p>The novel is dense with allegory and allusion, but despite its erudition it maintains a brisk pace as puns and witticism zip by. It influenced a huge number of authors, including Fritz Leiber and Robert A. Heinlein, and was widely considered a masterpiece of its time, with personalities like Alistair Crowley proclaiming it an “epoch-making masterpiece of philosophy.” Its publication and widespread popularity and acclaim set the stage for the modern fantasy-comedy genre perfected by authors like Terry Pratchett and Piers Anthony.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories by H. G. Wells in a variety of genres ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a> is probably best known for his imaginative longer works, such as his novels <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-war-of-the-worlds"><i>The War of the Worlds</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-invisible-man"><i>The Invisible Man</i></a>; but he was also a prolific short story writer. This Standard Ebooks edition of his short fiction includes fifty-four of Wells’ stories, written between 1894 and 1909 and compiled from the collections <i>The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents</i> (1895), <i>The Plattner Story and Others</i> (1897), <i>Tales of Time and Space</i> (1899), <i>Twelve Stories and a Dream</i> (1903) and <i>The Country of the Blind and Other Stories</i> (1911). They are presented here in approximate order of first publication.</p>
			<p>The stories vary wildly in genre and theme, ranging from tales of domestic romance, to ghost stories and tropical adventures, to far-future science fiction. Interestingly, many of the stories deal with the exciting but also frightening prospect of heavier-than-air flight and aerial warfare, and it is worth noting that these stories were written some years before the Wright brothers first took to the air.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphaned young man raised as an aristocrat’s nephew feels a moral obligation to assist others, and in doing so eventually discovers his true parentage and culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Daniel Deronda</i>, published in 1876, was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-eliot">George Eliot’s</a> last novel. It deals with two major characters whose lives intersect: One is a spoiled young woman named Gwendolen Harleth who makes an unwise marriage to escape impending poverty; the other is the titular character, Daniel Deronda, a wealthy young man who feels a mission to help the suffering.</p>
			<p>During her childhood Gwendolen’s family was well-off. She lived in comfort and was indulged and pampered. But the family’s fortune is lost through an unwise investment, and she returns to a life of near-poverty, a change which she greatly resents both for herself and for her widowed mother. The only escape seems to be for her to marry a wealthy older man who has been courting her in a casual, unemotional way. The marriage turns out to be a terrible mistake.</p>
			<p>Daniel Deronda has been raised by Sir Hugo Mallinger as his nephew, but Daniel has never discovered his true parentage, thinking it likely that he is Sir Hugo’s natural son. This consciousness of his probable illegitimacy moves him to kindness and tolerance towards anyone who is suffering from disadvantage. One evening, while rowing on the river Thames, he spots a young woman about to leap into the water to drown herself. He persuades her instead to come with him for shelter to a family he knows. The young woman turns out to be Jewish, and through his trying to help her find her lost family, Deronda comes into contact with Jewish culture—and in particular with a man named Mordecai, who has a passionate vision for the future of the Jewish race and who sees in Daniel a kindred spirit.</p>
			<p>The paths that Gwendolen and Daniel follow intersect often, and Daniel’s kindly nature moves him to try to offer her comfort and advice in her moments of distress. Unsurprisingly, Gwendolen misinterprets Daniel’s attentions.</p>
			<p>In <i>Daniel Deronda</i> Eliot demonstrates considerable sympathy towards the Jewish people, their culture, and their aspirations for a national homeland. At the time this was an unpopular and even controversial view. A foreword in this edition reproduces a letter Evans wrote to Harriet Beecher Stowe, defending her stance in this regard. Nevertheless, the novel was a success, and was translated almost immediately into German and Dutch. It is considered to have had a positive influence on Zionist thinkers.</p>
			<p><i>Daniel Deronda</i> has been adapted both for film and television, with the 2002 B.B.C. series winning several awards.</p>

		<summary type="text">Mark Twain’s semiautobiographical account of his travel across the United States.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Orion Clemens is appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, his brother Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Mark Twain</a>, joins him on his journey west. Together with their all-important six pounds of Unabridged Dictionary they make their way to Nevada in a six-horsed mail coach and are, of course, derailed by all sorts of problems.</p>
			<p>In <i>Roughing It</i> Twain combines the beautiful descriptions of the West’s idyllic landscape with his now-patented sense of humor. He joins the silver and gold mining scramble, begins his career as a writer working for different newspapers and journals, visits the Mormons of Salt Lake City, and even makes his way to Hawaii, then still known as the Sandwich Islands.</p>
			<p><i>Roughing It</i> was written as a prequel to his earlier travelogue <i>The Innocents Abroad</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl with an overactive imagination comes of age.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the coming-of-age story of Catherine Morland, a seventeen-year-old girl who’s entering society for the first time. Despite her naivete, she quickly gains two potential suitors. We follow Catherine as she tries to navigate the difficulties of romance, friendship, and responsibility—problems amplified by the fact that Catherine views her world through the lens of the dramatic Gothic novels she loves to read. Austen deftly satirizes both the Gothic novels popular at the time (especially Ann Radcliffe’s <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>), as well as contemporary society and woman’s role in it.</p>
			<p>Completed in 1803, Northanger Abbey was the first of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-austen">Jane Austen’s</a> novels to be completed, but it was only published posthumously in 1817.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two young men visit the countryside: one to find a wife, and the other to avoid one.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> is one of the few 18th century plays that has stood the test of time. First produced in 1773 in Covent Garden, it has been revived many times—once even running for 1,777 performances in the 1860s.</p>
			<p>The events take place over the course of a single evening in a country house where two young ladies await potential suitors. The young squire of the household, a prankster and layabout (and intended for one of the young ladies by the family matriarch), sets off a comic chain of mistaken identities and farcical intrigues when he encounters the potential suitors in a nearby tavern, and sends them to the house with the belief that they’re visiting an inn.</p>
			<p>The impact of <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> was such that it was heralded as restoring “laughing comedy” to the English stage after decades of sentimentality. It also stands as the origin of the phrase, “Ask me no questions and I’ll tell you no lies.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of science fiction short stories by Mack Reynolds ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mack-reynolds">Dallas McCord “Mack” Reynolds</a> was an American science fiction writer who authored almost two hundred short stories and novellas, was a staple in all the major science fiction and fantasy magazines and published dozens of science fiction novels. He began his writing career in the late 1940s. His fiction focused on exploring and challenging both the socioeconomic themes of the day and the implications of the Cold War that raged throughout his career. A thoughtful writer of speculative fiction, many of Mack Reynolds’ predictions have come to pass, including the credit-card economy, remote warfare and a worldwide computer network. His thoughts about the outcomes of both the Soviet and western political and economic systems are still highly relevant.</p>
			<p>This collection gathers stories that were published in <i>Analog</i>, <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>, <i>Amazing Stories</i> and others. Ordered by date of first publication, they range from spy adventures to the ultimate expression of corporate warfare and from a very short 1000-word story to full-blown novellas.</p>

		<summary type="text">A tragic scientist creates a monster in his laboratory.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mary-shelley">Mary Shelley</a> (then Godwin) and Percy Bysshe Shelley were visiting their friend Lord Byron in Geneva one rainy summer. With the weather against them, they decided to spend their time writing ghost stories for each other. <i>Frankenstein</i> is Mary Shelley’s submission to their contest, later published anonymously in 1818.</p>
			<p>Victor Frankenstein, a strange but brilliant scientist, discovers a method of imparting life to inanimate matter. The Monster is thus born: a hideous, 8-foot-tall creature of muscle, speed, and intellect. Frankenstein’s rejection of his appalling creation sends it into a spiral of despair, and Frankenstein’s life is never the same.</p>
			<p>Considered by many to be the first science fiction novel, <i>Frankenstein</i> is a powerful narrative that explores complex themes of belonging, morality, and the consequences of the power over life and death. This edition is based on Shelley’s revised 1831 edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">The humorous travelogue of a boating holiday down the Thames taken by three friends and their dog.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Three Men in a Boat</i> is one of the most popular English travelogues, having never been out of print since its publication in 1889 and causing its publisher to comment, “I cannot imagine what becomes of all the copies of that book I issue. I often think the public must eat them.”</p>
			<p>The novel itself is a brisk, light-hearted, and funny account of a two-week boating holiday taken by three friends up the Thames river. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jerome-k-jerome">Jerome</a> is a sort of everyman narrator, and even the stodgiest reader can sympathize with at least some of the situations and conundrums he and his friends find themselves in during their adventure.</p>
			<p>Interspersed between comic moments are slightly more serious descriptions of the picturesque villages and landscape the friends explore, making <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> not just a comic novel but an actual account of the life, times, and land of late 19th century greater London.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man builds a farm and a family as society changes around him.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Growth of the Soil</i> was published in 1917 to universal acclaim. A mid- to late-career work for <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/knut-hamsun">Hamsun</a>, it was celebrated for its then-revolutionary use of literary techniques like stream of consciousness, and for its unadorned depiction of pastoral life. Its focus on the quotidian lives of everyday people has led scholars to classify it as a novel of Norwegian New Realism.</p>
			<p>Isak, a man so strong and so simple that he echoes a primitive, foundational “everyman,” finds an empty plot of land in turn-of-the-century Norway, and builds a small home. He soon attracts a wife, Inger, whose harelip has led her to be ostracized from town life but who is nonetheless a hard and conscientious worker. Together the two earthy beings build a farm and a family, and watch as society and civilization grows and develops around them.</p>
			<p>Isak and Inger’s toils sometimes bring them up against the burgeoning modernity around them, but curiously, the novel is not one driven by a traditional conflict-oriented plot. Instead, the steady progression of life on the farm, with its ups and downs, its trials and joys, makes the <em>people</em> and their <em>growth</em> the novel’s main propellant. While the humble, homespun protagonists occasionally come into conflict with the awe-inspiring forces of civilization, more often than not, those forces are portrayed as positive and symbiotic companions to the agrarian lifestyle.</p>
			<p>Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920 for <i>Growth of the Soil</i>, one of the rare instances in which the Nobel committee awarded a prize for a specific novel, and not a body of work. It has since come to be regarded as a classic of modernist, and Norwegian, literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">Five bourgeois Swedish siblings, linked by their ancestral home, attempt to forge different paths in life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The five Selambs siblings have suffered the death of their mother and the incapacitation of their father, and consequently are left to fend for themselves, apart from the occasional check-in from both their guardian and the appointed manager of their ancestral estate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, none of them emerge unscathed from this upbringing, although the damage manifests itself in different and unforeseen ways. As they each attempt to forge their own path through the ranks of fin de siècle bourgeois Swedish society, it becomes apparent that none of them can escape the family traits of egoism and a desire for money regardless of ethics.</p>
			<p>In this bildungsroman with five subjects, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sigfrid-siwertz">Siwertz</a> charts the societal and cultural changes he observed during his own adolescence and early adulthood in Stockholm and the surrounding areas. <i>Downstream</i> (titled in the Swedish original simply as <i>Selambs</i>) is perhaps his best known work from a broad corpus of novels, short stories, poems and plays, and has remained highly regarded. Siwertz himself became part of the Swedish literary establishment later in life, as a member of the Swedish Academy and the Nobel Prize for Literature committee.</p>
			<p>This edition is based on the 1923 English translation by Macmillan of Canada.</p>

		<summary type="text">A beautiful woman lures a knight away from his duty to protect Europe from invaders.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Orlando Furioso</i>, one of the longest poems in European literature, is the sequel to Matteo Maria Boiardo’s incomplete epic poem <i>Orlando Innamorato</i>. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ludovico-ariosto">Ludovico Ariosto</a> continues the story’s fusion of French and British legends as well as including material from Greek and Latin literature.</p>
			<p>The Saracens and Christians are fighting over control of Europe. Agramant, the King of Africa, and his allies lay siege to Paris and Charlemagne’s forces. Meanwhile, Orlando, one of Charlemagne’s famous paladins, is returning to France with the captured pagan princess Angelica. Her beauty incites Knight Rinaldo to duel Orlando for her love. During the fight, she escapes.</p>
			<p>This tale of war, adventure, sorcery, romance, humor, tragedy, and redemption has influenced famous writers like Spenser and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, and continues to inspire writers to this day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A maid and butler take in a mysterious, eccentric gentleman lodger around the time of the Jack the Ripper murders.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Lodger</i> is the first known novelization of the Jack the Ripper story. It follows the lives of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bunting, a maid and butler. An eccentric lodger, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sleuth, arrives at their lodging-house just as a wave of horrific murders begins to sweep London. The Buntings become engrossed in the newspaper sensationalism as well the detailed accounts of their young friend, a Scotland Yard detective.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/marie-belloc-lowndes">Lowndes</a> first wrote <i>The Lodger</i> as a short story published in <i>McClure’s Magazine</i>, then later published the novelization in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> as a serial. It was very successful, with over a million copies sold within a few decades. Writers like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gertrude-stein">Gertrude Stein</a> praised it, with one contemporary reviewer calling it “the best novel about murder written by any living author.” It has since been adapted to other media, notably as one of Alfred Hitchcock’s first movies. Today the novel is still considered the best fictional adaptation of the Jack the Ripper legend.</p>

		<summary type="text">An engineer from 19th-century Connecticut is sent back in time to King Arthur’s medieval England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</i> is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Mark Twain’s</a> most enduring novels. During a stay at a modern-day English castle, the narrator meets a mysterious stranger. The stranger, Hank Morgan, is an engineer from Connecticut, and proceeds to weave a satirical, biting, and hilarious tale of how he traveled back in time to find himself in the court of the legendary King Arthur. There he uses his modern-day knowledge to convince the locals that he’s a powerful magician. As the book progresses, Hank modernizes—and Americanizes—the lives of the locals.</p>
			<p>Twain’s talent for humor and satire are on full display in <i>Yankee</i>, and he doesn’t waste the opportunity to use Hank as a mouthpiece for his views on things like politics, capitalism, and justice. Many consider it to be his best work.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman moves to Chicago to chase her dream of being somebody.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Caroline Meeber, known as Sister Carrie to her family, moves to Chicago at the tender age of eighteen to try to make something of herself. Living with her sister and brother-in-law, she quickly finds that life, and work, are hard in the big city. She soon takes up with a traveling salesman she met on the train into town. Months later her eye is turned by one of the salesman’s acquaintances, George Hurstwood, and vice-versa. A series of events lead Carrie and Hurstwood to New York City, where both struggle to live out the aspirations that brought them there.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/theodore-dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a> was one of the earliest naturalist writers, but he wrote <i>Sister Carrie</i> while the United States was still very Victorian in its morals. The book therefore caused a stir from the beginning: Carrie Meeber was clearly, even in the disguised language of the time, a sexually active, unmarried female, who wasn’t made to suffer for her indiscretion to the extent considered necessary at the time. Dreiser’s depiction of rough language merely added to the controversy. The first printing sold only 456 copies in two years; it was to be another five years before Dreiser could convince another publisher to carry the book. Today it’s considered a classic and one of the “greatest of all American urban novels.”</p>
			<p>The text of <i>Sister Carrie</i> was unchanged until 1981, when the University of Pennsylvania Press published a new version with 36,000 words restored. The edition was not without controversy: the cuts were originally made before the first printing at the suggestion of Dreiser’s wife, or his friend Arthur Henry, and Dreiser had approved all of them. Although the new Pennsylvania Edition, as it is called, made a good case for restoring the changes, it is the 1907 text that remains the most widely available today, and it is that text in this edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman struggles with the opposing forces of class and love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Grace Melbury, daughter of a rich local wood-trader, has been raised beyond her family through years of expensive education. Coming home, she finds herself pulled between her love for her childhood friend Giles Winterborne, and the allure of the enigmatic Doctor Fitzpiers. Giles and Edgar have their own admirers too, and the backdrop of the bucolic pastures and woodlands of an impressionistic take on south-west England provides the perfect setting for their story.</p>
			<p><i>The Woodlanders</i> was commissioned by <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i> in 1884, and was serialized and later published as a novel in 1887. The story’s themes of infidelity and less-than-blissful marriage were unusual for the time and drew ire from campaigners, but on its publication it garnered immediate critical acclaim. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-hardy/">Thomas Hardy</a> later regarded it as the favorite of his stories, and it’s remained perennially popular as a novel and as a series of adaptations to theatre, opera and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">A discussion of the distinction between an Acquisitive Society, one guided by profits, and a Functional Society, one guided by service.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“The faith upon which our economic civilization reposes, the faith that riches are not a means to an end but an end, implies that all economic activity is equally estimable whether it is subordinated to a social purpose or not.”</p>
			<p>So states <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/r-h-tawney">R. H. Tawney</a> in this treatise on the difference between an Acquisitive Society, one guided purely by profits, and a Functional Society, one guided by professional motives. In the former—which is largely the world we live in today—businesses are concerned only with making profit for their owners, who have little or no connection to the industry they own, and high-quality service and efficient use of labor is at best only a pleasant byproduct. Tawney contrasts this view of society with the latter society, in which businesses are run by professionals instead of owners. In this scenario, professional considerations not related to financial profit would lead to better service and higher efficiency, as well as happier workers.</p>
			<p>As an executive of the socialist Fabian Society, Tawney was considered one of the most influential historians of the early twentieth century, especially in politics, where he was a major contributor to the British Labour Party. His influence extended beyond Britain as well, and he has been credited with influencing the policies of Swedish Social Democrats.</p>

		<summary type="text">A portrait of the life of a drug addict in Georgian-era London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-de-quincey">Thomas De Quincey</a> spent much of his life addicted to the powerful drug opium. This book, first published anonymously in the <i>London Magazine</i>, is the autobiographical account of his addiction. De Quincey’s compelling language and frankness give the reader a window in to both the strange pleasures and the horrible pains of that famous drug.</p>
			<p>As the science of addiction was an unheard of thing at the time, De Quincey’s account became a sort of authoritative reference for decades, with people going so far as to denounce the book for presenting too pleasurable a picture of opium use. His work stands as a fascinating window into the life of a Georgian-era addict in one of the busiest cities in the world.</p>

		<summary type="text">A middle-class country wife tries to satisfy her yearnings for a luxurious life by engaging in various affairs.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Madame Bovary</i>, often ranked among the greatest novels of all time, is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-flaubert">Flaubert’s</a> first novel, and considered to be both his masterpiece and one of the most influential works in literary history, with authors from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">Henry James</a> to Proust to Nabokov heaping it with praise.</p>
			<p>The novel tells the story of Emma Bovary, a commoner wife of a country doctor, and her attempts to escape the drudgery of day-to-day mediocrity by engaging in adulterous affairs and overspending on luxuries. She remains unsatisfied even though her husband adores her and they want for little, and her shallowness eventually leads to their ruin.</p>
			<p>The story was first serialized in <i>Revue de Paris</i>, where prosecutors tried to have it censored for obscenity, arguing that not only is the story immoral, but that realism as a literary style is an offence against art and decency. The trial only served to increase the story’s fame, and when it was published as a single novel it quickly became a bestseller.</p>
			<p>The novel is groundbreaking in its emphasis on the psychological and emotional lives of its characters. Literature up to then had mostly focusing on the external events that make characters react, instead of focusing on the internal thought processes of those characters. <i>Madame Bovary</i> changed that forever. It was also revolutionary in its criticism of the middle class, which at the time was a still-new social class vying for elbow room between the working poor and hereditary aristocracy. Flaubert critiqued the middle class as being ambitious, shallow, greedy, materialistic, and totally without culture; Emma’s burning desire to reach even higher social strata, contrasted against that satisfaction being fundamentally denied to her by her middle-class nature, is an early echo of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels">Marx’s</a> theory of alienation in industrial societies.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Madame Bovary</i>, with its careful but charming description of the banality of everyday life, is considered the first great example of literary realism in fiction novels. Eleanor Marx-Aveling’s translation, though over a hundred years old, is remarkably fresh and smooth, and is a pleasure even for modern readers.</p>

		<summary type="text">A series of letters in which two narcissistic French aristocrats manipulate and ruin their peers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> (<i>Les Liaisons dangereuses</i>) is an early French novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/pierre-choderlos-de-laclos">Pierre Choderlos de Laclos</a>, first published in four volumes in 1782. At the time of its publication novels were a new literary form, and Laclos chose to present his story in an epistolary style, composing the novel solely of a series of letters written by the major characters to each other. It was first translated into English in 1812 and has since become universally regarded as one the most significant early French novels.</p>
			<p>The story is framed around the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, two narcissistic French aristocrats and rivals who enjoy games of seduction and manipulation, and who most especially enjoy one-upping each other. The letters they send to each other portray an interconnected web of seduction, revenge, and malice, and are interspersed with the more innocent letters of their victims.</p>
			<p><i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> has often been seen as a depiction of the corruption and depravity of the French nobility shortly before the French Revolution, thereby making a negative statement about the Ancien Régime. But it’s also a depiction of the timeless problems surrounding sex and love, and a realistic portrayal of desires that are often beyond our control. As Laclos enjoyed the patronage of Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Orléans, and as other royalist and conservative figures like Queen Marie Antoinette enjoyed the book, it’s likely it wasn’t seen as a morality tale until after the French Revolution.</p>

		<summary type="text">Four generations of the Pontifex family grow to adulthood in Victorian England, encountering challenges that satirize the era along the way.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Way of All Flesh</i> is often considered to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-butler">Samuel Butler’s</a> masterpiece, and is frequently included in many lists of best English-language novels of the 20th century. Despite this acclaim, Butler never published it in his lifetime—perhaps because the novel, a scathing, funny, and poignant satire of Victorian life, would have hit his contemporaries too close to home.</p>
			<p>The novel traces four generations of the Pontifex family, though the central character is Ernest Pontifex, the third-generation wayward son. The reader follows Ernest through the eyes of his watchful godfather, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Overton, as he strikes out from home to find his way in life. His struggles along the way illustrate the complex relationships between a son and his family, and especially his father; all while satirizing Victorian ideas about family, church, marriage, and schooling.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Thomas Paine’s essays on republicanism, the problems of monarchy, and human rights.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-paine">Thomas Paine</a> was an American political commentator and activist in the latter part of the eighteenth century. His writing covered a wide range of subjects, but were centered on his core beliefs of republicanism and the inherent rights of people. An early pamphlet of his, “Common Sense,” was written soon after he arrived in America from Great Britain; with its focus on the ills of colonialism and the King’s veering between rational debate and righteous outrage, it has been cited as one of the major catalysts for the American Revolution. Later work attempted to correct the mistakes he perceived in post-revolution French government—written from experience after his election to the French National Convention—and even suggested a costed plan for a universal basic income funded by an inheritance tax.</p>
			<p>Collected here are his essays and pamphlets written between 1776 and 1797, including the aforementioned “Common Sense” and other influential works like “The Republican Proclamation” and the “Declaration of Rights.”</p>

		<summary type="text">Maugham’s semi-autobiographical masterpiece follows a club-footed orphan’s rise in the medical profession and his lifelong search for happiness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Considered by many to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham">Maugham’s</a> masterpiece, <i>Of Human Bondage</i> is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale. The novel follows Philip, a sensitive young man interested in literature and art, as he searches for happiness in London and Paris. Philip, the ostensible stand-in for Maugham, suffers from a club foot, a physical representation of the stutter that Maugham himself suffered. Philip’s love life, a central aspect to the book, also mirrors Maugham’s own stormy affairs.</p>
			<p>Maugham originally titled the book “Beauty from Ashes” before settling on the final title, taken from a section of Spinoza’s <i>Ethics</i> in which he discusses how one’s inability to control one’s emotions results in a form of bondage.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of essays on art, literature, philosophy, society, and culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-hazlitt">William Hazlitt</a> was a well-regarded critic and essayist in his day, and <i>Table-Talk</i>, a collection of some of his more popular short essays, is perhaps his best-remembered work.</p>
			<p>The essays themselves range in subject from philosophy, to art, to literature, culture, society, and politics, with titles like “On the Pleasures of Painting” and “On Corporate Bodies.” Hazlitt’s intimate style and deep familiarity with many different aspects of art culture (not only was he a literary success, but he studied under Joshua Reynolds to be a portrait painter) make his essays fascinating multi-disciplinary reads.</p>
			<p><i>Table-Talk</i> was originally published in two separate volumes, and, largely due to Hazlitt’s political activism, was received poorly by his contemporaries. Today it’s considered one of his masterpieces.</p>

		<summary type="text">The meta-fictional commentary on the life of “famous” German philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdröckh and his Philosophy of Clothes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Sartor Resartus</i> was a strange and new book when it was first published in 1833, and in many ways it remains a strange and new book today. The bulk of the novel takes the form of the a commentary on the life and works of the fictional Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a sort of renaissance-man German philosopher who develops a “Philosophy of Clothes.” The commentary is composed by a fictional English commentator, known only as the “Editor”; the Editor claims to have translated many of Teufelsdröckh’s ideas and quotes from German. As the commentary progresses, the Editor receives a bag of paper scraps on which are written various autobiographical fragments from Teufelsdröckh’s life. The Editor’s attempts to organize and interpret these scraps forms the second part of the novel.</p>
			<p>The work is multi-faceted: sometimes a parody, sometimes a comedy, sometimes a satire, and sometimes seriously philosophical. Some critics consider it an early existentialist text. At the very least its unique structure and use of meta-narrative is hugely influential to modern literature; Borges was said to have memorized entire pages, and modern texts like Nabokov’s <i>Pale Fire</i> borrow liberally from the concept of a meta-narrative organized on scraps of paper.</p>

		<summary type="text">T. E. Lawrence’s memoir of leading the Arab revolt against the Ottoman empire during World War I.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-e-lawrence"><abbr>T. E.</abbr> Lawrence’s</a> memoir of his involvement in leading a portion of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman empire during World War I. The empire had joined the side of Germany and the Central Powers in the war, and Britain hoped that a successful revolt would take the empire out of the war effort. Britain had also promised the Arabs that, if they were successful, England would recognize a single Arab state.</p>
			<p>Lawrence convinced the Arab leaders, who had historically not shown a willingness to work together, to join forces in supporting Britain’s strategy in the area. His memoir is part travelogue, part philosophy treatise, and part action novel. It details his movements and actions during his two year involvement, his relationships with the various Arab leaders and men who fought with him, and his thoughts—and doubts—during that time. It’s a gripping tale made famous by the movie <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, and one that Winston Churchill called “unsurpassable” as a “narrative of war and adventure.”</p>
			<p>The manuscript of <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> has a rich history. Lawrence finished his first draft in 1919 from his notes during the war, but lost most of it when changing trains in England (it was never found). The next year, he started working on a new version from memory that ended up being sixty percent longer than the original. He then edited that version (although it was still a third longer than the original draft), finishing it in early 1922, and had eight copies of it printed to give to friends so they could review it and offer editing suggestions (and to prevent a repeat of losing his only copy). About this time he re-enlisted in the service, but friends convinced him to work on a version he could publish. In 1926, he had a first edition of approximately 200 copies published that included 125 black-and-white and color illustrations from sixteen different artists. The first edition lost money, and it was the only edition published during his lifetime. This edition uses the first edition text and includes all 125 of the original illustrations, including both endpapers.</p>

		<summary type="text">Pavel Chichikov travels through Russia buying the titles of dead serfs.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dead Souls</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/nikolai-gogol">Nikolai Gogol’s</a> last novel, and follows the tale of Pavel Chichikov, a down-on-his-luck gentleman determined to improve his lot in life. The story charts his scheme to purchase dead souls—the titles of deceased serfs—from wealthy landowners.</p>
			<p>The novel’s satirical take on the state of Russian society at the time leads Chichikov into increasingly difficult circumstances, in his attempts to cheat both the system and the cavalcade of townspeople he meets along the way.</p>
			<p>Originally planned as a trilogy, Gogol apparently only completed the first two parts, and destroyed the latter half of the second part before his death. The novel as it stands ends in mid sentence but is regarded as complete.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of John Keats’ published poems, and a selection of unpublished fragments and posthumous verse.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-keats">John Keats’</a> poems are a major part of the second wave of English Romantic poetry. They portray settings loaded with symbolism and sensuality, and draw heavily on Greek and Roman myth along with romanticised tales of chivalry. Keats died in 1821 at the young age of 25, having written the majority of his work in less than four years. While not appreciated during his lifetime, he has gone on to become one of the most loved of the Romantic poets, and has provided inspiration to authors as diverse as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilfred-owen">Wilfred Owen</a> and Neil Gaiman.</p>
			<p>This collection includes among others early work such as “On Death,” the six odes written in 1819, his two epics <i>Hyperion</i> and <i>Endymion</i>, and “To Autumn,” now widely considered to be one of the best English short poems. Keats’ works are presented here in chronological order, and include the poems published in his lifetime and other unfinished fragments and posthumous verse.</p>

		<summary type="text">Newly-married Hedda Gabler struggles to control her life and the lives of those around her.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Hedda, the proud and willful daughter of General Gabler, newly married to George Tesman, returns from her honeymoon to Norway. She chafes at the prospect of a dull life in a loveless marriage until a former lover, Eilert Løvborg, returns and throws their financial future into disarray. The appearance of Hedda’s old schoolmate Thea, who wants to reform Løvborg, and Judge Brack, who wants Hedda in his power, leave her struggling to build the life she wants.</p>
			<p><i>Hedda Gabler</i> was first performed in Munich in 1891, and within months there were productions in Berlin, Copenhagen, London, and New York. It was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henrik-ibsen">Ibsen’s</a> first play to be translated from proofs before performance or publication. Productions of the play have won two Olivier Awards and been broadcast in multiple countries; since 1917, it has been adapted into more than a dozen feature films in almost as many languages.</p>

		<summary type="text">The autobiography of English philosopher John Stuart Mill.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill">John Stuart Mill</a> was one of the most influential philosophers of the 19th century. His more well-known works include <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill/on-liberty">On Liberty</a></i>, a highly-influential treatise applying the Utilitarian philosophy to systems of government, and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill/the-subjection-of-women">The Subjugation of Women</a></i>, a treatise arguing for gender equality in an age where that was anything but the norm.</p>
			<p>Besides these monumental works, he also produced <i>A System of Logic</i>, an important work on the philosophy of science, <i>Principles of Political Economy</i>, one of the most influential economics textbooks of the 19th century, and many other notable books of philosophy. When not composing profound tracts that would shape philosophy in the next century, he wrote volubly in various magazines and newspapers of the day, became the godfather of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bertrand-russell">Bertrand Russell</a>—himself the 20th century’s most prominent logician—and even spent time as a Member of Parliament, becoming the first M.P. in history to call for women to be given the right to vote.</p>
			<p>But perhaps the most interesting part of Mill’s rich life is his education. His father, Utilitarian philosopher James Mill, raised John in a special mode of education purposefully designed to produce a genius, with the intent of making John the standard-bearer of Utilitarianism in the next generation. To this end he kept young John isolated from his school-age peers to prevent them from making him feel too smart, and gave John a rich classical, moral, and scientific education. By the age of three John was studying Greek, and by eight he was studying Latin and in charge of educating his younger siblings; by twelve, he was studying scholastic logic, and had already consumed nearly all of the major Greek and Latin classics in their original language. That James Mill’s unique method of education produced a genius is without a doubt, and John’s youthful experiences are recounted here in detail.</p>
			<p>This short and to-the-point autobiography is a fascinating window into the life of one of the 19th century’s most important thinkers.</p>

		<summary type="text">The personal diary of the Roman Emperor, in which he lays out his thoughts and philosophical musings on the Stoic philosophy and way of life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Roman Emperor <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/marcus-aurelius">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus</a> was the model of what we call a philosopher-king. Though his rule was troubled by war and conflict, he remained a thoughtful and even-handed ruler.</p>
			<p><i>Meditations</i> isn’t a complete book, but rather a collection of his personal diary entries written over a ten-year campaign in Greece. The entries were never meant to be published; instead, they were a reminder to himself of how to remain calm, tranquil, and kind, even in the worst of situations. In them we see the emperor working out how to deal with the everyday problems all of us face: annoying coworkers, difficult family members, the expectations of others, unrealized goals and achievements, and, ultimately, happiness.</p>
			<p>The episodic nature of <i>Meditations</i> makes it hard to follow at times, but in exchange we get a deeply personal window into the life of one of Rome’s most unique emperors, and more importantly, a handbook of thoughtful advice on how to live a tranquil, satisfied, and productive life.</p>

		<summary type="text">King Henry VIII plans to divorce his first wife for Anne Bullen.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Henry VIII</i> is one of the few of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> plays thought to have been written with a collaborator. It was initially published in the First Folio under Shakespeare’s name only, but in 1850 James Spedding, an English author and expert on the works of Francis Bacon, suggested that the play was a collaboration with John Fletcher, a playwright who later replaced Shakespeare in the King’s Men acting company. Modern scholars mostly tend to agree, though the theory is still controversial as it’s based on textual analysis and not any historical mention of a collaboration. The play is also famous for having burned down the Globe Theatre in 1613 during one of its early performances, when a cannon shot special effect lit the theater’s thatched roof on fire.</p>
			<p>In the play, King Henry’s closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey, is hated by the citizens of England. Wolsey has imposed unfair taxes and unpopularly executed the Duke of Buckingham for treason. While at a party, the King falls madly in love with Anne Bullen and plans to divorce his current wife, Katherine of Aragon. Wolsey is asked to help his King in this endeavor, all the while becoming even more hated by the English and their Queen.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">King John is commanded to hand over his throne to Arthur of Bretagne or face war with the French.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>An ambassador sent by King Philip of France delivers an ominous threat: King John must relinquish his throne to its rightful heir, his nephew Arthur of Bretagne, or France will declare a “fierce and bloody war.” John refuses. After receiving this news, Philip orders his forces to prepare an attack on the English-controlled French town of Angiers, and the citizens must then swear allegiance to Arthur or die.</p>
			<p>King John also must deal with a dispute over land ownership between the Faulconbridge brothers. Their father knew that the older son was not his, and before his death, he bequeathed all of his lands to the younger son. John rules that the bastard son rightfully owns the lands regardless of who is his true father. John’s mother, Elinor, sees that the bastard son resembles Richard the Lionheart and proposes that he renounce his claim to the Faulconbridge land in exchange for a knighthood. He agrees and becomes Sir Richard Plantagenet.</p>

		<summary type="text">Despite their best efforts, the rumormongers of 18th-century London are disappointed by their targets.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>One of the most celebrated English comedies of manners, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/richard-brinsley-sheridan">Sheridan’s</a> <i>The School for Scandal</i> was first produced in 1777 at London’s Drury Lane Theatre. It opened just a year after Sheridan succeeded the famous actor/manager David Garrick as manager and, after Garrick had read the play, he even volunteered to write the prologue—lending his much desired endorsement to the production. <i>The School for Scandal</i> was extremely well received by its audiences as well as by many contemporary critics.</p>
			<p>The plot revolves around members of London’s Georgian society who delight in rumor and gossip and the infelicities and flaws of others. Although they draw their victims from their own membership, they let no action go un-noted or uncriticized. But as the plot unfolds events don’t always prove quite so titillating, and not a few find themselves victims of their own love of scandal.</p>
			<p>The comedy of manners was a staple of Restoration theatre with William Congreve and Molière being its most famous proponents. After it fell out of favor it was revived in the later part of the 1700s when a new generation of playwrights like William Goldsmith and Richard Sheridan took up writing them again. Praised for its tight writing and razor wit, <i>The School for Scandal</i> skewered high-society with such spirited ridicule and insight that it earned Sheridan the epithet of “the modern Congreve.”</p>

		<summary type="text">The residents of a small pre-industrial Ohio town lead their lives amidst a backdrop of pervasive loneliness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, is set in a fictional town in early 1900s America based on <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sherwood-anderson">Anderson’s</a> boyhood memories of his hometown of Clyde, Ohio. The novel is actually a series of interconnected short stories, with each one focusing on the life of a different resident of the sleepy, pre-industrial town. Though each story peers into the personal life of a different character, the common threads running through all of them are George Willard, the young reporter for the <i>Winesburg Eagle</i>—and a pervasive sense of loneliness, even despair. As the stories obliquely trace George’s coming of age, he becomes a symbol of the hope the town holds for the future as its citizens struggle against the oppressive smallness of their existence and their paradoxical inability to form meaningful bonds with each other in such a small community.</p>
			<p>The stories in <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> are of a decidedly melancholy nature, but their real beauty lies in the vivid characterization of the big personalities living in the small town. The simplicity of Anderson’s plain-styled prose paints a rich picture, with each character precisely portrayed in all of their dusty down-to-earth physicality. One can almost picture the narrator as the whiskey-soaked voice of Tom Waits, rolling each syllable around in his mouth as the summer heat lies heavy in the twilight air.</p>
			<p>Atmosphere aside, the stories are also unique in that Anderson creates narrative tension not with plot development, but with insights into the psychology of the kinds of people who choose, or don’t choose, to live in Winesburg. This makes the novel one of the earliest examples of literary modernism. It was praised by its contemporaries on publication, with H. L. Mencken stating that the novel “embodies some of the most remarkable writing done in America in our time.” It remained both acclaimed and widely read throughout the 1930s, when its popularity waned with the author’s own. In the 1960s critics reevaluated it, firmly placing it in the canon of modern American classics.</p>

		<summary type="text">A seminal collection of essays on the African-American experience.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When it was first published in 1903, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-e-b-du-bois">W. E. B Du Bois’s</a> <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> represented a seismic shift in the discussion of race in the United States. Earlier African-American authors had broken ground with memoirs and autobiographical novels—narrative works that portrayed the African-American experience through the stories of particular individuals. What Du Bois envisioned was a work that portrayed the experience of African Americans <em>as a people</em>.</p>
			<p>As a professor of sociology, Du Bois naturally gravitated toward a scientific and scholarly approach. But he was also becoming, to his own surprise, a political activist, and found himself increasingly disenchanted with purely intellectual arguments when his fellow African Americans were being lynched, starved, and driven from their land. What emerged from this tension between scholarly rigor and righteous indignation was a book that became a seminal text for both sociology and for the civil rights movement.</p>
			<p>The fourteen essays in this book weave together historical research, sociological analysis, first-hand reportage, political argument, and an enduring, aspirational belief in the possibility of America. Many of the ideas that Du Bois introduced in the book have become mainstays of modern discourse, including the “veil of race” and the concept of double consciousness. These insights, originally rooted in race, have proven resonant to a wide range of other marginalized groups and have provided a useful framework for understanding the nature of oppression and the path to liberation.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young shepherd falls in love with a young, seemingly independent and strong-willed lady farmer.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-hardy">Thomas Hardy’s</a> fourth novel and was completed in 1874. It was originally serialized in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> and was quickly published in a successful single volume.</p>
			<p>Hardy described Wessex as “a merely realistic dream country” and so it is in <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>, where an idyllic view of the countryside is interrupted by the bitter reality of farming life. The novel is the first that Hardy sets in fictional Wessex; he quickly realised that setting novels there could be a money-earner that would subsidise his poetry-writing ambitions.</p>
			<p>Gabriel Oak, the faithful man and aspiring farmer; Bathsheba Everdene, the young and independent lady farmer; William Boldwood, the lonely neighbour; and Sergeant Troy, the dashing military man, all lead intertwined lives which are full of love and loss.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of T. S. Eliot’s poetry, including “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” “The Waste Land,” and “The Hollow Men.”</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Poetry</i> of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-s-eliot"><abbr>T. S.</abbr> Eliot</a> collects all of his early work through “The Hollow Men.” Poems like “The Love Song of <abbr>J.</abbr> Alfred Prufrock,” “Whispers of Immortality,” and “Gerontion” ponder aging and mortality, while “Sweeney Erect,” “<abbr>Mr</abbr>. Eliot’s Sunday Service,” and “Sweeney Among the Nightingales” sketch the temptations and agonies of the modern man in the character of Sweeney.</p>
			<p>Woven throughout with allusions to works in six foreign languages and sporting over fifty footnotes by the author, “The Waste Land” is as notorious for its bleak picture of a post-war world as it is for its density and difficulty. “The Hollow Men” ends with one of the most famous stanzas in English poetry.</p>
			<p>Eliot’s flashes of insight bring the everyday into stark relief. Whether suffering an insufferable bore, observing the lives of strangers on the streets, or juxtaposing the sacred and the profane, his sometimes autobiographical vignettes of modern life still feel current a century after they were penned.</p>

		<summary type="text">A country lawyer finds love and adventure as he seeks revenge during the French Revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Scaramouche</i> tells the tale of André-Louis Moreau, a young lawyer in Brittany. When his friend is killed by an unremorseful landowner, Moreau swears revenge and begins a life of adventure on the run. His travels lead him to joining a traveling theater troupe, becoming a master swordsman, and even to revolution.</p>
			<p>While the story of <i>Scaramouche</i> is fiction, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rafael-sabatini">Sabatini</a> was always very careful to portray history as accurately as he could in his novels. Thus, the backdrop of the French Revolution is vibrant, immediate, and carefully described. In general Sabatini’s prose is sharp and entertaining.</p>
			<p><i>Scaramouche</i> was incredibly popular in its day, and was Sabatini’s most famous novel. The first line is written on Sabatini’s grave.</p>

		<summary type="text">An English doctor is caught up in a rebellion and sentenced to transportation to the Caribbean, but later escapes slavery to become a pirate.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Peter Blood, with experience as a soldier and sailor, is practicing medicine in Bridgewater, England, when he inadvertently gets caught up in a rebellion being waged by the Duke of Monmouth. After being convicted of treason, Blood and some of the rebels are sentenced to slavery in the Caribbean. The year is 1688.</p>
			<p>During the course of Blood’s servitude, he works on the sugar plantation of Colonel Bishop and becomes infatuated with the colonel’s niece, Arabella. When Bishop realizes that Blood is an accomplished physician he “employs” Blood in that capacity.</p>
			<p>When the colony is attacked by a Spanish force, Blood and some of the other slaves manage to escape and take over the Spanish ship. Several of the other escapees turn out to be experienced seaman, including as officers in the British navy. This group turns the Spanish ship into a very successful pirate ship, specializing in raiding Spanish shipping.</p>
			<p>This begins Captain Blood’s journey toward redemption and his “courtship” of Arabella.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rafael-sabatini">Sabatini</a> based Blood’s character on several historical figures, including a doctor who was sentenced to slavery (but did not become a pirate), as well as Henry Morgan (who was a pirate). His most well known novel was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rafael-sabatini/scaramouche"><i>Scaramouche</i></a>. Sabatini also wrote a number of short stories about Captain Blood in the early 1920s.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of stories featuring P. G. Wodehouse’s charismatic character Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse"><abbr class="name">P. G.</abbr> Wodehouse’s</a> less famous characters. He first appears in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse/love-among-the-chickens"><i>Love Among the Chickens</i></a> in 1906 and then continues to make appearances in another 19 short stories until as late as 1966, making him Wodehouse’s longest running character.</p>
			<p>Ukridge is an inveterate opportunist, and these stories chronicle his exploits as a young man: his trials and tribulations as one who is destined for greatness, if the rest of the world would only cooperate. Told from the point of view of his long-suffering friend and fellow bachelor “Corky” Corcoran, they chronicle their many meetings in the years before the period of <i>Love Among the Chickens</i>.</p>
			<p>As with most of his stories, Wodehouse published the first 10 stories in both the U.S. (<i>Cosmopolitan</i>) and the UK (<i>Strand Magazine</i>) before they were published in the 1924 collection <i>Ukridge</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman struggles against the intellectual confines of her rural Australian life in the late 19th Century.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>My Brilliant Career</i> is a classic Australian work published in 1901 by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/miles-franklin">Stella Miles Franklin</a>, with an introduction by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-lawson">Henry Lawson</a>. A thinly-veiled autobiographical novel, it paints a vivid and sometimes grim picture of rural Australian life in the late 19th Century.</p>
			<p>Sybylla Melvyn is the daughter of a man who falls into grinding poverty through inadvised speculation before becoming a hopeless drunk unable to make a living from a small dairy farm. Sybylla longs for the intellectual things in life such as books and music. She wants to become a writer and rebels against the constraints of her life. For a short period she is allowed to stay with her better-off relatives, and there she attracts the attentions of a handsome and rich neighbour, Harold Beecham. The course of true love, however, does not run smoothly for this very independent young woman.</p>
			<p>The author, like many other women writers of the time, adopted a version of her name which suggested that she was male in order to get published. Today, the Miles Franklin Award is Australia’s premier literary award, with a companion award, the Stella, open only to women authors.</p>
			<p><i>My Brilliant Career</i> was made into a well-regarded movie in 1979. Directed by Gillian Armstrong, it features Judy Davis as Sybylla and Sam Neil as Harry Beecham.</p>

		<summary type="text">The gentleman-thief scrambles to save the lives of two of his accomplices.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin’s</a> attempted robbery of the deputy Daubrecq has gone horribly wrong, leaving behind a murdered man and two of his accomplices in the hands of the police. Now he finds himself pulled into an ever more conspiratorial spiral as he attempts to gain leverage over the people who can free his men. Set before the events of the preceding <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc/813/alexander-teixeira-de-mattos"><i>813</i></a>, this again portrays Lupin in a much different light to the earlier books. At times almost coming to despair, this story shows him grappling with his personal morals whilst trying to do the best for those closest to him.</p>
			<p>The story was originally serialised in <i>Le Journal</i> in 1912, before being published as a novel in both the original French and this English translation by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in 1913.</p>

		<summary type="text">A sardonic and generally unflattering biography of Victoria Alexandrina, Queen of England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The publication of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lytton-strachey">Lytton Strachey’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lytton-strachey/eminent-victorians">Eminent Victorians</a></i> in 1918 was a tremendous success. In it, Strachey looked at four iconic figures of the Victorian Age and punctured the hagiographical illusions surrounding them. It seems only fitting that he should follow up in 1921 with a similarly unsentimental but fair biography of the person at the pinnacle of that era, Queen Victoria herself.</p>
			<p>Thoroughly researched, with his references documented in hundreds of footnotes, Strachey looks at the life of the young woman who, when she was born, was by no means certain to become the British monarch. He also spends considerable time on her consort, Prince Albert, who, in Strachey’s telling, develops from a careless youth to becoming a truly remarkable and effective figure in British society, while continuing to be generally perceived as an outsider.</p>
			<p>Strachey’s sardonic and witty style makes this account of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert an entertaining and very informative read.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl is sent to live with her wealthy relatives at a country estate, where she must navigate adolesence and young adulthood.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>At the age of 10, Fanny Price, the daughter of a poor Portsmouth family, is sent to live with her wealthy uncle’s family, the Bertrams, at the country estate of Mansfield Park. The Bertrams treat her cruelly at first, and Fanny has trouble fitting in. Her female cousins, Maria and Julia, are fashionable and vapid, and her elder male cousin, Tom, is a drunk. The only family member she feels a connection to is the younger Edmund, who is preparing for life in the clergy.</p>
			<p>When her uncle leaves to manage business in Antigua, Henry and Mary Crawford, siblings from the region, come to live at Mansfield Park as well. Their arrival begins a series of romantic engagements that strains the entire family’s relationships.</p>
			<p><i>Mansfield Park</i> is unusual in that despite it being a great public success, with the first edition selling out in six months and a second edition selling out two years later, it wasn’t publicly reviewed until 1821, seven years after it was first published. Contemporary reviews were generally good, praising the novel’s morality. Modern reviews are more mixed, making it one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-austen">Austen’s</a> more controversial works. Modern critics have called it everything from eccentric and difficult to thoughtful and profound, with any number of interpretations possible depending on the lens one views the work through.</p>

		<summary type="text">A philosopher sets out to rescue the beautiful Caitilin Ni Murrachu from the god Pan in an adventure that involves leprechauns, Celtic gods, policemen, and philosophical disquisitions both profound and absurd.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When the ancient god Pan appears in Ireland and the beautiful Caitilin Ni Murrachu decides to follow him, her father asks an old philosopher to deliver her back. In his quest, the philosopher requests the help of the Celtic god of love, experiences catharsis, and is apprehended by policemen tipped off by leprechauns, provoking a second rescue mission—for himself.</p>
			<p>It is through this humorous mixture of philosophy and Irish folklore that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-stephens">James Stephens</a> presents deep philosophical questions and social commentary. The novel’s meandering plot sets the stage for contrasts between man and woman, city and countryside, and virtue and vice.</p>
			<p>First published in 1912, <i>The Crock of Gold</i> is the book that established James Stephens’ fame.</p>

		<summary type="text">A series of adventures in London, including those of the narrator and a little boy named David, and Peter Pan.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Little White Bird</i> is generally divided into three sections: the first chronicles the narrator’s life in London, beginning with how he came to know a little boy named David (who joins him on his adventures), and describes other matters of his everyday life.</p>
			<p>The second section tells the story of how Peter Pan came to be a “betwixt-and-between” and his adventures in Kensington Gardens, including his interactions with the birds as well as the fairies hidden in the park.</p>
			<p>Finally, the third section of the book revisits London with the narrator and David. The two make brief visits to Kensington Gardens and embark on a new adventure to Patagonia.</p>
			<p><i>The Little White Bird</i> is the first story to include the famous Peter Pan character, two years before <i>Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up</i>, the play that made the character famous. While <i>The Little White Bird</i> can be described as a prelude to the play, inconsistencies such as Peter Pan’s age make the two stories incompatible.</p>

		<summary type="text">An autobiographical account of a young biracial girl abandoned by her parents and forced into servitude in the northern United States.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Our Nig</i> is an an autobiographical novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/harriet-e-wilson">Harriet E. Wilson</a>, her only published work. It was written not for pleasure, but to financially support the lives of the author and her sick child. It was long considered to be the first novel published by an African-American woman in the United States, but recent research has put that title into question.</p>
			<p>Frado, born to a white mother and black father, is abandoned by her parents at age six and left to the Bellmont family. Though the Bellmonts live in the northern United States, the matriarch of the family, Mrs. Bellmont, loathes her for her dark skin color. She forces Frado (nicknamed “Nig”) to do the chores of the family under the threat of rawhide floggings and beatings. However, not everyone agrees with Mrs. Bellmont’s treatment of their new family member.</p>

		<summary type="text">The account of several slaves who are sold to new owners after their current owner experiences financial hardship.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Faced with the possibility of financial ruin, slave owner Arthur Shelby decides to sell two of his slaves: Uncle Tom and a young boy named Harry. Eliza, Harry’s mother, makes the decision to run away while Uncle Tom decides that his moral duty is to submit to his master and cooperate with the sale. The story follows the diverging lives of these two slaves—Eliza’s flight to Canada and Uncle Tom’s journey into the deep south.</p>
			<p>Eliza is accompanied by her husband, George, who also escaped from his owner at the same time. Together they must outrun bounty hunters and somehow make their way to freedom. Uncle Tom, on the other hand, must face the uncertainty of new owners and separation from his family, while somehow remaining true to his religious faith.</p>
			<p>Upon its release, <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> sparked immediate criticism from slave owners and praise from abolitionists. Its influence was such that one apocryphal story claims that Abraham Lincoln, upon meeting <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/harriet-beecher-stowe">Stowe</a>, stated “so this is the little lady who started this great war.”</p>
			<p>The book remains controversial, with critics pointing to Uncle Tom’s passive nature and the extensive use of racial stereotypes. Despite this, the novel’s influence is undeniable, and it helped pave the way for modern protest literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short works by science fiction legend Philip K. Dick.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/philip-k-dick">Philip <abbr>K.</abbr> Dick</a> built an enduring literary reputation writing powerful science fiction in the pulp magazines of the 50s and beyond. This collection of several of his short works, arranged in chronological order and all published in now-defunct science fiction pulp magazines, is a slice from his early career. Many of these stories explore the themes of war and whether humanity is intrinsically violent and conflict-torn. Each of them is a fascinating jewel of speculative fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">One of the greatest generals of the United States tells the story of his life and details his key role in winning the Civil War.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Personal Memoirs</i> of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ulysses-s-grant">Ulysses Simpson Grant</a> are an American classic. In them Grant, the most able General of the Civil War, tells the story of his life and experiences, covering his birth, early youth, military training at West Point, his involvement as a Lieutenant in the Mexican War of 1847–48, and of course, his role in the Civil War of 1861–65, during which he rose to become the supreme commander of the Northern forces. After the Mexican War, Grant had left military service and became, essentially, an unsuccessful shopkeeper. Re-enlisting at the start of the Civil War, he rose to his ultimate position entirely on his own merits, showing himself to be a skilled strategist and a master of logistics.</p>
			<p>What distinguishes Grant’s <i>Personal Memoirs</i>, and makes them a clear candidate for being considered a part of American literature, is the high quality and interest of the writing, for which Grant clearly had a talent. Though he goes into an extremely high level of detail about the military movements and struggles of the Civil War, the book is full of interest, and in parts is as gripping as a novel.</p>
			<p>Obviously, Grant tells only his own part of the story and from the perspective of the ultimately successful forces; but his humanity shows through in the respect he offers to those on the other side, and in his acknowledgement of their sufferings, despite his clear condemnation of their cause of preserving slavery. He is generous in awarding due credit to others on his own side, and where blame is due tempering it with his understanding of that person’s character, background and circumstances.</p>
			<p>After the war, Grant served two terms as President of the United States between 1869–77, but his <i>Memoirs</i> do not deal with this period. He began writing the book on his retirement, and completed it only after suffering from severe illness and not long before his death from throat cancer. The first edition was published in two volumes by Mark Twain in 1885.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition includes 43 maps reproduced from the 1895 edition of the <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">The influential Scottish-American naturalist spends a summer exploring the high country surrounding the headwaters of the Merced and Tuolumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, and records what he sees in a diary.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the summer of 1869, Scottish-American naturalist and author <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-muir">John Muir</a> spent the months of June through September in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California accompanying a group of shepherds while they led a flock of sheep to the high country to graze. During that time, Muir took every opportunity to explore the Yosemite area extensively—hiking, camping, writing, and sketching. Muir’s diary entries describing the land, flora, and fauna he encountered became the basis for the book <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, first published in 1911.</p>
			<p>Muir’s journal entries from that summer reveal his growing wonder and awe at the Yosemite landscape, as well as his endless curiosity for the natural world. On a grand scale, he trekked into remote areas for sometimes days at a time. He climbed Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana and trekked through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake. On a more modest scale, Muir observed the flora and fauna that surrounded him with the keen enthusiasm of a naturalist. He described in detail the area’s trees, shrubs, flowers, mountain meadows, glacial features, and animals.</p>
			<p>In the years that followed the publication of <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, Muir went on to advocate for the protection and preservation of wild landscapes. In 1892, Muir co-founded the Sierra Club and became the organization’s first president. Muir also played an instrumental role in the establishment of several national parks including Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon.</p>
			<p><i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> remains among John Muir’s most popular works. The book’s inspired and lyrical accounts of an iconic wilderness, written at a time in Muir’s life when his character as a naturalist and wilderness advocate was taking form, earns it a prominent, influential place in the annals of nature writing and the history of wilderness preservation.</p>

		<summary type="text">A traveller ventures to the unknown country of Erewhon and finds a surprisingly different culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In a desire for better sheep-farming land on an unnamed British colony, Higgs decides to traverse the distant mountain range. On the other side he discovers not the empty rolling plains of his imagination but an entirely new civilization: the land of Erewhon. Inducted into the ways of their culture, he attempts to transcribe as best he can their thoughts on birth, death, machines, the production of food, their financial system, and many more subjects that on first glance seem absurd to the narrator but often end up revealing absurdity in his own thinking.</p>
			<p><i>Erewhon</i> was extremely well received on its initial (and anonymous) publication, with its satirical commentary on contemporary Victorian attitudes ensuring its commercial success. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-butler">Samuel Butler</a> incorporated into the novel his philosophical ideas, including chapters founded on his interest in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-darwin">Darwinian</a> evolution theory, and on the potential rise in artificial consciousness. George Orwell held the novel in high regard, and the Erewhonian philosophy on the danger of machines even made its way into Frank Herbert’s <i>Dune</i> series as the “Butlerian jihad.”</p>

		<summary type="text">Three men travel to Africa and encounter a 2000-year old woman.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A professor is entreated by a dying colleague to take custody of the colleague’s five-year old son, raise him to adulthood, and at that time pass on a chest to him. The professor does so, and when the child reaches adulthood and the chest is revealed, it leads them on an adventure to Africa. There they encounter a young queen of a lost race who says she’s over two thousand years old, with an equally startling claim about the young man.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-rider-haggard">H.

Haggard wrote the book in six months “in a white heat,” and handed the manuscript to his agent with the remark, “There is what I shall be remembered by.” Haggard was right: with its setting in darkest Africa and a woman at its center described as the most beautiful in the world, <i>She</i> was a sensation at its release, has never been out of print, and has sold upwards of 100 million copies.</p>

		<summary type="text">Kropotkin explores the role of cooperation in animal societes and human societies, past and present, and how it could benefit modern society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/peter-kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> initially published the chapters of <i>Mutual Aid</i> as individual essays in the intellectual periodical <i>The Nineteenth Century</i> over the course of six years. In 1902 the essays were published as a book.</p>
			<p>In it, Kropotkin explores the role of mutually-beneficial cooperation across both animal and human societies. He begins by outlining how animals, both within and across species, thrive not through individual fitness, but rather through mutual cooperation. He then extends the breadth of his study to ancient human societies across generations and nations, until arriving at modern society, which he suggests has largely dispensed with the ancient benefits of mutual aid in favor of private property, capitalism, and social Darwinism.</p>
			<p>Though more of a philosophical work than a scientific work, many of Kropotkin’s observations of the animal kingdom are considered to be scientifically accurate today, with Douglas H. Boucher calling <i>Mutual Aid</i> a precursor to the theory of biological altruism.</p>
			<p>As a philosophical work <i>Mutual Aid</i>, along with his other work <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/peter-kropotkin/the-conquest-of-bread/chapman-and-hall">The Conquest of Bread</a></i>, is recognized as a foundational text of the anarcho-communist political philosophy.</p>

		<summary type="text">Hilaire Belloc takes a walking pilgrimage to Rome from his hometown in France, writing of the journey, sketching the sights, and digressing on a wide variety of subjects.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Path to Rome</i> is British-French writer and historian <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hilaire-belloc">Hilaire Belloc’s</a> first travelogue. It describes the pilgrimage he took to Rome as the result of a vow he made while visiting his hometown of Toul, in Lorraine, France. In his own copy of the book, dated May 29, 1904, he notes: “I wrote this book for the glory of God.”</p>
			<p>Belloc walked “two and a half hundred leagues” to Rome, over twenty-two days, and arrived in time to hear Mass on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. As he walks, he quickly discovers the difficulty of keeping every vow he made before starting, as the days are long, the mountains steep, and his finances stressed. But the book is far more than a simple travelogue; alongside the narrative of the journey, Belloc wanders into topics as varied as the art of writing, life in the military, his Catholic faith, the middle class, literary criticism, music, poetry, and more. His unique politics and personality shine in his many digressions and asides.</p>
			<p><i>The Path to Rome</i> sold very well, and many critics have viewed it as the book that made Belloc’s name. His great friend <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> said of it in <i>The World</i>: “<i>The Path to Rome</i> is the product of the actual and genuine buoyancy and thoughtlessness of a rich intellect. …”</p>

		<summary type="text">The novel offers a satirical description of the American middle class around 1920.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>George F. Babbitt is a middle-aged realtor, family man, and resident of Zenith, a fictitious Midwestern city. His main preoccupation is to climb the social ladder by conforming to the norms of his environment. The novel depicts his daily routines and occasional misadventures in an unorthodox writing style, where the protagonist appears altogether foolish, funny, and pathetic.</p>
			<p>This work was both celebrated as an incisive satire of American culture and criticized as an exaggeration, but was ultimately influential in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis">Sinclair Lewis</a> being awarded the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman becomes a heroine of the Revolutionary War on the American frontier.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Betty Zane</i>, published in 1903, was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/zane-grey">Zane Grey’s</a> first novel. It tells the romanticized story of Grey’s great-great-aunt, who made a miraculous dash under fire to save a frontier fort from Indian attack.</p>
			<p>Fort Henry sat on the site of present-day Wheeling, West Virginia. One of a series of fortifications built to protect frontier settlers, it was commanded by Colonel Ebenezer Zane, and was the center of a small community where Colonel’s brothers and his sister Betty lived. The fort survived two sieges by Native Americans, first in 1777 and again in 1782. In the 1782 siege the attacking tribes were joined by British soldiers; and it is this siege, and the events leading up to it, that are recounted in <i>Betty Zane</i>.</p>
			<p>Grey claimed to derive the facts in his story from the personal notebook, preserved in his family, of his great-grandfather Ebenezer Zane, but it’s impossible for readers to distinguish historical fact, the supposed contents of the notebook, and the Grey’s own imagination. Certainly some aspects of the tale, like Betty’s romantic involvements, are entirely fictionalized. But equally certainly, other major aspects of the tale, in particular Betty’s heroism during the siege, come straight from the pages of history.</p>

		<summary type="text">A famous Roman general wants to run for consul.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Rome has transitioned from a monarchy to a republic. The last king of Rome was dead, and the Senate and rich aristocrats now control Rome. The citizens are starting to riot due to a food shortage. The plebeians blame the patrician Caius Marcius for hoarding grain and fixing prices, but Marcius believes the citizens don’t deserve grain if they’ve never served in the military. To calm the plebeians, five tribunes are chosen to represent the common people in legal matters. Soon after, a Volscian army attacks, and Marcius leaves the city to fight.</p>
			<p>After a successful siege on the city of Corioli and the defeat of the Volscian army, Caius Marcius is rewarded with the name of Caius Marcius Coriolanus. He returns to Rome a hero, beloved by both the Senate the plebeians. Coriolanus is encouraged to pursue politics and run for consul, a position elected by the people. There are others, like the tribunes Brutus and Sicinius, who still remember Coriolanus’ disdain for the plebeians and view him as an enemy.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">When a fabulous gem mysteriously goes missing, suspicion abounds and a hunt begins for the guilty party.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The “Moonstone” of the title is a large but flawed diamond, looted from India at the time of the Mutiny by an unscrupulous British officer. Many years later, estranged from his family due to his licentious lifestyle, the officer bequeaths the diamond to his sister’s daughter, Rachel Verrinder, to be given to her on her 18th birthday. Due to the ill-omens surrounding the gem, this may have been an act of revenge rather than reconciliation. The diamond, it appears, was taken from a statue of the Moon God worshipped by a Hindu cult, and it has long been sought by a group of Brahmins determined to return it to their temple.</p>
			<p>On the night of the birthday party the gem mysteriously disappears from Rachel’s room. While the first suspicions naturally fall on these Indians, they are eventually exculpated. Rachel becomes hysterical and angry when questioned about the theft and refuses to assist the police. Active efforts to assist them are taken up by Rachel’s cousin (and sweetheart) Franklin Blake. These efforts simply drive Rachel into further fury, and she becomes completely estranged from him. Suspicion thus falls on her as having some secret reason for wishing to raise money on the diamond. The novel proceeds to slowly uncover the mysteries involved.</p>
			<p>Published in 1868, <i>The Moonstone</i> is often considered as one of the precursors of the modern detective novel, though this is a label which would not have been used by its author <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins</a> and his contemporaries. While it is true that the plot revolves around the mystery of a theft, and that it features Sergeant Cuff “in the Detective Force of Scotland Yard,” the novel is much more about character and relationships than the mere revelation of secrets. It also has a good dose of Collins’ humour, as the story is told in large part by eccentric characters such as the old house-steward Gabriel Betteredge who regards <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></a> as an oracle; and the ultra-religious Miss Clack, determined to convert everyone to her views.</p>
			<p>Immensely popular at the time of its publication in serial form, <i>The Moonstone</i> is rightly considered to be one of Collins’ best works, and remains highly regarded today.</p>

		<summary type="text">After two sisters are unexpectedly and shockingly disinherited, the headstrong younger sister takes increasingly desperate measures to try to wrest back her family’s fortune.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>No Name</i> is set in England during the 1840s. It follows the fortunes of two sisters, Magdalen Vanstone and her older sister Norah. Their comfortable upper-middle-class lives are shockingly disrupted when, after the sudden deaths of their parents, they discover that they are disinherited and left without either name or fortune. The headstrong Magdalen vows to recover their inheritance, by fair means or foul. Her increasing desperation makes her vulnerable to a wily confidence trickster, Captain Wragge, who promises to assist her in return for a cut of the profits.</p>
			<p><i>No Name</i> was published in serial form like many of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins’</a> other works. They were tremendously popular in their time, with long queues forming awaiting the publication of each episode. Though not as well known as his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white"><i>The Woman in White</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone"><i>The Moonstone</i></a>, <i>No Name</i> is their equal in boasting a gripping plot and strong women characters (a rarity in the Victorian era). Collins’ mentor <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</a> is on record as considering it to be far the superior of <i>The Woman in White</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman who has been made pregnant by an unscrupulous man tries to force him to marry her secretly, but much goes wrong with her plan.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Man and Wife</i> is the ninth novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins</a>, and was published in serial form in 1870. Like many of his other novels it has a complex plot and tackles social issues, in this case the then-lax state of the marriage laws, particularly in Scotland and Ireland. As always, Collins deals carefully but frankly with human personal behavior. To avoid offending Victorian morals too greatly, much is implied rather than stated outright. Nevertheless, even dealing with such matters at all led to his novels being derided as “sensation fiction” by his critics. By today’s standards, of course, they wouldn’t even raise an eyebrow.</p>
			<p>In <i>Man and Wife</i>, the main character Anne Silvester has fallen pregnant to a muscular and handsome, but boorish man, Geoffrey Delamayn, to whom she is not married. She is working as a governess at a house in Scotland. Anne arranges to meet Delamayn secretly at a garden party and angrily demands that he fulfill his promise to marry her, that very day. He very reluctantly agrees to a secret, private marriage, knowing that a public marriage would badly affect his inheritance prospects. How is the marriage to be arranged quickly but kept quiet? Anne has a plan based on her understanding of the looseness of the marriage laws in Scotland. Naturally, of course, things go badly wrong with this plan and many complexities arise.</p>
			<p>Collins is deeply critical of the state of contemporary marriage laws, both in how loosely they were framed, and in how little power over their own lives they gave to women once they were married, even if married to a brutal man. He also uses this novel to denounce the worship of sporting heroes and the obsession with physical prowess rather than mental superiority as a primary indication of male virtue.</p>
			<p>Though not as popular as his novels <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white"><i>The Woman in White</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone"><i>The Moonstone</i></a>, <i>Man and Wife</i> received a good critical reception when it was released and was a commercial success.</p>

		<summary type="text">A disinherited knight returns from the Crusades and fights back against Prince John’s reign.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Set in 12th-century England, Prince John rules while his brother King Richard is away during the Crusades. During his reign, Prince John and others of Norman nobility abuse their power over the Saxons, forcing Saxons off their lands and many Saxon nobles into serfdom.</p>
			<p>Ivanhoe, a man disowned by his own Saxon father for going to war alongside the Norman King Richard, returns from the Crusades in disguise and appears in a tournament at Ashby. After revealing himself, Prince John and his advisors learn that King Richard, too, has returned from the crusades.</p>
			<p>Foiling Prince John’s plot against King Richard’s return to power, King Richard battles against Prince John’s allies, and executes the most guilty of his conspirators. After the events of the story, Ivanhoe leads a heroic career under King Richard until the king’s untimely death.</p>
			<p><i>Ivanhoe</i> is the first novel to feature the character Robin Hood, his merry men, and Friar Tuck, and serves as the basis for the portrayals of his character we still see in many modern adaptations.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young engaged couple meet a mysterious man who claims to have practical knowledge of the occult.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In Paris, surgeon Arthur Burdon and his fiancé are introduced to Oliver Haddo, a wealthy Englishman from an old family who claims to be a magician trained in the occult. At first they are unconvinced and irritated by Haddo’s boasts; however he soon demonstrates his powers in more and more fateful ways.</p>
			<p>The character of Oliver Haddo is an unflattering caricature of the English occultist Alistair Crowley, whom <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham">Maugham</a> had met while living in Paris. Crowley himself wrote a review in <i>Vanity Fair</i> in which he accused Maugham of plagiarizing various other novels, signing off as “Oliver Haddo.” Most critics dismissed these allegations.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Vladimir Korolenko’s translated short stories and novellas, ordered by date of translated publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/vladimir-korolenko">Vladimir Korolenko</a> was a Ukrainian author and humanitarian. His short stories and novellas draw both on the myths and traditions of his birthplace, and his experiences of Siberia as a political exile due to his outspoken criticism of both the Tsars and the Bolsheviks. His first short story was published in 1879, and over the next decade he received many plaudits from critics and other authors, including <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov</a>, though he also received some criticism for perceived uneven quality. He continued writing short stories for the rest of his career, but thought of himself more as a journalist and human rights advocate.</p>
			<p>Korolenko’s work focuses on the lives and experiences of poor and down-on-their-luck people; this collection includes stories about life on the road (“A Saghálinian” and “Birds of Heaven”), life in the forest (“Makar’s Dream” and “The Murmuring Forest”), religious experience (“The Old Bell-Ringer,” “The Day of Atonement” and “On the Volva”) and many more. Collected here are all of the available public domain translations into English of Korolenko’s short stories and novels, in chronological order of their translated publication. They were translated by Aline Delano, Sergius Stepniak, William Westall, Thomas Seltzer, Marian Fell, Clarence Manning and <i>The Russian Review</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">An archdeacon of Notre-Dame and his bellringer fall in love with the same gypsy, with tragic results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Esmeralda is a breathtaking beauty and attracts the attention of men all around her, including an actor, a captain, and an archdeacon, to whom she is of course forbidden. But because of a kindness she paid to him, there is one whose love for her is pure: the archdeacon’s bellringer. The actions of the archdeacon, who cannot control his lust for the young woman, ultimately draws all four men into her orbit, and his, with tragic consequences.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo">Hugo’s</a> tragic novel is an ode to gothic architecture in general and that of Notre-Dame de Paris in particular. Hugo was upset both at the neglect of buildings like Notre-Dame, and the modernization of those that weren’t being neglected. By centering on the building, he was able to bring all classes into his story: from kings and nobles to bellringers and sewer rats. The first American translation changed the title to “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” shifting attention to the bellringer, but Hugo’s focus was always on Notre-Dame and the beautiful gothic architecture of Paris.</p>

		<summary type="text">A disgraced priest ends up adventuring with a group of societal outcasts.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Set in the 1820s in central Sweden, <i>The Story of Gösta Berling</i> follows the saga of the titular character as he falls from the priesthood and is rescued by the owner of a local estate. Joining the other saved souls in the pensioners’ wing of the mansion, he embarks upon a series of larger-than-life stories that tell of adventure, revelry, romance and sadness.</p>
			<p><i>Gösta Berling</i> was the eventual Nobel Prize winner <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/selma-lagerlof">Selma Lagerlöf’s</a> first published novel, and was written as an entry to a magazine competition. The richly detailed landscapes of Värmland were drawn from her own upbringing there, and the local folk tales inspired many of the individual stories in the book. The novel was published in Swedish in 1891; this edition is based on the 1898 English translation by Pauline Bancroft Flach. In 1924 the story was made into a silent film, launching the career of Greta Garbo.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphaned street-urchin follows a holy man across India during the time of the British Raj, eventually gaining an education and becoming a recruit to the Great Game of espionage against the Russians.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling">Rudyard Kipling’s</a> novel <i>Kim</i>, published in 1901, tells the story of Kimberly O’Hara (“Kim”), the orphaned son of an Anglo-Irish soldier, who grows up as a street-urchin on the streets of Lahore in India during the time of the British Raj. Knowing little of his parentage, he is as much a native as his companions, speaking Hindi and Urdu rather than English, cunning and street-wise.</p>
			<p>At about the age of twelve, Kim encounters an old Tibetan lama on a pilgrimage in search of a holy river. He decides to fall in with the lama on his travels, and becomes in essence the old man’s disciple. Not long after, Kim is captured at an encampment of British soldiers under suspicion of being a thief. His parentage is discovered and the officers decide he must be raised as a “Sahib” (an Englishman) and sent off to school. The interest of the British officers in Kim is not entirely disinterested, however, as they see his potential for acting as a courier and spy as part of their “Great Game” of espionage against their bitter rivals the Russians, and ensure that he is trained accordingly.</p>
			<p><i>Kim</i> is a well-loved book, often being listed as one of the best English-language novels. Its depiction of the India of the time, its varied races, religions, customs and scenery is detailed, rich and sympathetic. And the manoeuverings of the players in the Great Game make for an entertaining adventure story.</p>

		<summary type="text">Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves try their hand at matchmaking in upper-class England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Right Ho, Jeeves</i> is the second novel to feature <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse"><abbr>P. G.</abbr> Wodehouse’s</a> popular Bertie Wooster and Jeeves characters. Bertie, a member of the English upper class and one of the “idle rich,” tries his best to arrange relationships between two pairs of his friends. Though he means well, Bertie’s bumbling attempts wind up doing more harm than good (as usual), leaving it to his valet, Jeeves, to see if he can sort things out.</p>
			<p>A smooth, easy, and often hilarious read, <i>Right Ho, Jeeves</i> is an excellent example of why Bertie Wooster and Jeeves have become such iconic literary figures.</p>

		<summary type="text">As a poor boy grows up to be a man, he becomes determined to solve the plight of his fellow men.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Pelle is still just a young boy when his father decides to move them from Sweden to the Danish island of Bornholm in search of riches. Those riches—of course—being nonexistent, they fall into the life of farm laborers. As Pelle grows up among the other lowly and poor residents of the island, their cares and worries seep into him, and he finds himself part of a greater struggle for their dignity.</p>
			<p><i>Pelle the Conqueror</i> has been compared to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo">Victor Hugo’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo/les-miserables/isabel-f-hapgood" lang="fr">Les Misérables</a></i> in its themes and scope. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/martin-andersen-nexo">Nexø</a> had become involved in the Social Democratic movement in Denmark that flourished after the turn of the 19th century, and this work closely follows his journalistic observations of the struggles of the people. It was published in four books between 1906 and 1910, and was immensely popular; the first book in particular is still widely read in Danish schools, and was made in to an award-winning 1987 film starring Max von Sydow as Father Lasse.</p>
			<p>In this Standard Ebooks edition books one and four are translated by Jesse Muir, while books two and three are translated by Bernard Miall.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> was the most successful of a long series of novels written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/m-e-braddon">Mary Elizabeth Braddon</a> in what was then called the “sensation” genre because of the inventive and slightly scandalous plots of such works.</p>
			<p>Published in 1862, <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> was immediately popular and is said to have made a fortune for its author. It has never been out of print and has been the basis for a number of dramas and movies.</p>
			<p>The novel begins with the return from the Australian goldfields of ex-dragoon George Talboys. Three years earlier, in the depths of poverty, he had abandoned his young wife and their baby in order to seek his fortune. He returns to England having made that fortune by finding a huge gold nugget. He enlists the help of his friend Robert Audley, a rather idle young barrister, to seek out his wife. To George’s dismay and overwhelming grief, however, he sees a newspaper notice of the death of his wife only a few days prior to his return.</p>
			<p>A year later, when visiting Audley’s relatives and after catching a glimpse of the pretty new wife of Robert’s uncle, George goes missing. Robert becomes increasingly convinced that his friend has met with violence and is dead, and begins to investigate. What he discovers fills him with despair.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of all of the short stories and novellas written by Leo Tolstoy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>While perhaps best known for his novels <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/war-and-peace/louise-maude_aylmer-maude"><i>War and Peace</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/anna-karenina/constance-garnett"><i>Anna Karenina</i></a>, the Russian author and religious thinker <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> was also a prolific author of short fiction. This Standard Ebooks edition compiles all of Tolstoy’s short stories and novellas written from 1852 up to his death, arranged in order of their original publication.</p>
			<p>The stories in this collection vary enormously in size and scope, from short, page-length fables composed for the education of schoolchildren, to full novellas like “Family Happiness.” Readers who are familiar with Tolstoy’s life and religious experiences—as detailed, for example, in his spiritual memoir <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/a-confession/aylmer-maude"><i>A Confession</i></a>—may be able to trace the events of Tolstoy’s life through the changing subjects of these stories. Some early stories, like “The Raid” and the “Sevastopol” sketches, draw from Tolstoy’s experiences in the Caucasian War and the Crimean War when he served in the Imperial Russian Army, while other early stories like “Recollections of a Scorer” and “Two Hussars” reflect Tolstoy’s personal struggle with gambling addiction.</p>
			<p>Later stories in the collection, written during and after Tolstoy’s 1870s conversion to Christian anarcho-pacifism (a spiritual and religious philosophy described in detail in his treatise <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener"><i>The Kingdom of God is Within You</i></a>), frequently reflect either Tolstoy’s own experiences in spiritual struggle (e.g. “The Death of Ivan Ilyitch”) or his interpretation of the New Testament (e.g. “The Forged Coupon”), or both. Many later stories, like “Three Questions” and “How Much Land Does a Man Need?” are explicitly didactic in nature and are addressed to a popular audience to promote his religious ideals and views on social and economic justice.</p>

		<summary type="text">The legendary warrior Hadji Murád struggles to free his family against the backdrop of Russian imperialism in Chechnya and Dagestan.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this short novel, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> fictionalizes the final days of Hadji Murád, a legendary Avar separatist who fought against, and later with, Russia, as the Russian Empire was struggling to annex Chechnya and the surrounding land in the late 1840s.</p>
			<p>The novel opens with the narrator finding a thistle crushed in a blooming field, which reminds him of Hadji Murád and his tragic tale. As the narrator recounts the story, the reader is quickly thrust into the rich, colorful history of the Caucuses, and its people’s fight against Russian imperialism.</p>
			<p>Hadji Murád is portrayed as a legendary and imposing, yet friendly and approachable figure. Despite his reputation, it seems that his best days are behind him; as the novel opens, Murád is fleeing Shamil, a powerful imam who has captured Murád’s family. Murád finds himself thrust between the invading Russians on one side, and Shamil’s vengeance on the other.</p>
			<p>As Murád and his tiny but loyal group of warriors try to forge alliances in their attempt to rescue Murád’s family, they quickly find themselves politically outclassed. The Russians are Murád’s enemies, yet only they can help him in his struggle against Shamil; and after years of losses incurred by Murád’s guerrilla tactics, the Russians would like his help but cannot trust him. Shamil, on the other hand, is a deep link to the region’s complex web of tribal blood feuds, vengeances, reprisals, and quarrels over honor. He’s one of the few powers left standing between the Russians and their control of the Caucuses, but Murád, having crossed him, can’t rescue his family from Shamil’s clutches without the help of the Russians.</p>
			<p>Murád’s impossible position, the contradiction between his legendary past and his limping, dignified, and ultimately powerless present, and the struggle against a mighty empire by a people torn by internecine conflict, form the major thematic threads of the novel.</p>
			<p>The novel was one of the last that Tolstoy finished before his death, and was only published posthumously in 1912. Tolstoy himself served in the Crimean War, and the war scenes portrayed in the novel echo his personal experiences. As the story progresses, Tolstoy characterizes various real-life historical personalities besides Hadji Murád and Shamil, including Emperor Nicholas I, Mikhail Loris-Melikov, and Count Vorontsov-Dashkov, making this a fascinating piece of historical fiction. Despite this being such a late entry in Tolstoy’s corpus, it has been highly praised by critics both contemporary and modern, with the famous critic Harold Bloom going so far as to say that <i>Hadji Murád</i> is “my personal touchstone for the sublime of prose fiction, to me the best story in the world, or at least the best I have ever read.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A socialite starts an affair with a cavalry officer, against a backdrop of wealthy family life in Imperialist Russia.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Anna Karenina is certainly somewhat unhappy in her life, but presents a strong and vivacious character when called in to smooth over a major crack that’s appeared in her brother’s marriage. Unfortunately, the very visit designed to help her brother introduces her to Count Alexei Vronsky and sets in motion a chain of events that will ripple through families and the unforgiving society of wealthy Moscow and <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg.</p>
			<p>Initially serialized over five years in <i>The Russian Messenger</i>, <i>Anna Karenina</i> was first published as a two-volume novel in 1878. It was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy’s</a> second novel, coming after <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/war-and-peace/louise-maude_aylmer-maude"><i>War and Peace</i></a> and further cementing his role as the primary Russian author of his age. Tolstoy drew on his aristocratic upbringing to set the scene for the novel, and it’s widely believed that he wrote his own experiences and struggles with religion (documented in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/a-confession/aylmer-maude"><i>A Confession</i></a>) into the central character of Konstantin Levin.</p>
			<p>This edition compiles into a single volume the 1901 English translation by Constance Garnett.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three men attempt to cross Africa by balloon.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Five Weeks in a Balloon</i> tells the tale of three Englishmen who attempt to cross Africa, from east to west, in a balloon. Dr. Ferguson is the rational scientist leading the trio, accompanied by loyal sidekick Joe and the doctor’s sporting friend Kennedy.</p>
			<p>The three embark on many adventures: They encounter natives and dangerous animals, experience problems with their ballooning technology, and struggle with the winds and the weather. Throughout the novel, the author liberally sprinkles descriptions of flora, fauna, and geography, as seen through nineteenth century eyes.</p>
			<p>Though this is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne">Verne’s</a> first published book, he already demonstrates much of the formula that drive his later works: the well-defined characters led by a rational scientist, the focus on science and technology, and of course the adventure-filled plot.</p>
			<p>The novel, first published in 1863, was topical for its time, as European interest in African exploration was strong. At the time the book was published, David Livingstone was midst-exploration in south-east Africa, and Burton and Speke had recently returned from exploring the Great Lakes region. The novel itself contains many references to actual expeditions that would have been current or recent for the original readers of the novel.</p>

		<summary type="text">A minor government official travels the Australian outback and talks to a variety of characters such as bullock-team drivers and swagmen along the way.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Such Is Life</i> is an Australian novel written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-furphy">Joseph Furphy</a> under a pseudonym of “Tom Collins” and published in 1903. It purports to be a series of diary entries by the author, selected at approximately one-month intervals during late 1883 and early 1884. “Tom Collins” travels rural New South Wales and Victoria, interacting and talking at length with a variety of characters including the drivers of bullock-teams, itinerant swagmen, boundary riders, and squatters (the owners of large rural properties). The novel is full of entertaining and sometimes melancholy incidents mixed with the philosophical ramblings of the author and his frequent quotations from Shakespeare and poetry. Its depictions of the Australian bush, the rural lifestyle, and the depredations of drought are vivid.</p>
			<p>Furphy is sometimes called the “Father of the Australian Novel,” and <i>Such Is Life</i> is considered a classic of Australian literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A narrative tracing the ups and downs of a nouveau-riche upper-middle-class English family at the end of the Victorian era.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Between 1906 and 1921 <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-galsworthy">John Galsworthy</a> published three novels chronicling the Forsyte family, a fictional upper-middle class family at the end of the Victorian era: <i>The Man of Property</i>, <i>In Chancery</i>, and <i>To Let</i>. In 1922 Galsworthy wrote two interconnecting short stories to bind the three novels together and published the whole as <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>.</p>
			<p>While the novels follow the Forsyte family at large, the action centers around Soames Forsyte—the scion of a nouveau-riche London tea merchant—his wife Irene, and their unhappy marriage. Soames and his sprawling family are portrayed as stereotypes of unhappy gilded-age wealth, their family having entered the industrial revolution poor farmers and emerged as wealthy bourgeoise. Their rise was powered by their capacity to acquire, won at the expense of their capacity for almost anything else.</p>
			<p>Thematically, the saga focuses on the mores of the wealthy upper-middle class, which was still a newish feature in the class landscape of England at the time; duty, honor, and love; and the rapidly growing differences across generations occurring in a period of war and social change. The characters are complex and nuanced, and the situations they find themselves in—both of their own making, and of the making of society around them—provide a rich field for analyzing the close of the Victorian age, the dawn of the Edwardian age, and the societal frameworks that were forged in that frisson.</p>
			<p>Galsworthy went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932 for <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>, one of the rare occasions in which the Swedish Academy has awarded a prize for a specific work instead of for a lifetime of work.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two sisters take long journeys to love in early nineteenth-century England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When her husband dies and leaves his estate to his son from a former marriage, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dashwood and her three daughters are offered a cottage on the estate of a distant relative. The two oldest daughters fall in love, only to find that the objects of their affection have secrets that throw their lives into an uproar. The reserved oldest daughter and impetuous, fiery middle daughter will take very different journeys to discovering the true worth of their respective beaus.</p>
			<p>Published in 1811, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, was largely written fifteen years earlier, when <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-austen">Austen</a> was approximately the same age as her older protagonist Elinor. It was published anonymously (“By A Lady”), possibly due to propriety, or perhaps because she wanted to avoid any negative publicity if the book was not well-received. She needn’t have worried; it sold out its first printing of a modest 750 copies. She used well-defined characters, humor, and satire to paint a vivid picture of life in the England of George III, with all of its manners, class issues, and unwritten rules of behavior. That it’s still being read over two hundred years later is a testimony to her brilliance.</p>

		<summary type="text">Fifteen short stories about middle-class life in early 20th-century Dublin.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Dubliners</i> is a collection of picturesque short stories that paint a portrait of life in middle-class Dublin in the early 20th century. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">Joyce</a>, a Dublin native, was careful to use actual locations and settings in the city, as well as language and slang in use at the time, to make the stories directly relatable to those who lived there.</p>
			<p>The collection had a rocky publication history, with the stories being initially rejected over eighteen times before being provisionally accepted by a publisher—then later rejected again, multiple times. It took Joyce nine years to finally see his stories in print, but not before seeing a printer burn all but one copy of the proofs. Today <i>Dubliners</i> survives as a rich example of not just literary excellence, but of what everyday life was like for average Dubliners in their day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A murder in London’s Middle Temple uncovers a twenty year old conspiracy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Spargo, reporter extraordinaire for the <i>Watchman</i>, stumbles over a murdered man in London’s Middle Temple Lane, and, based on a journalistic hunch, decides to investigate. As the circle of interest widens, strange connections start to emerge; connections that lead towards an unsuspected conspiracy of twenty years before.</p>
			<p><i>The Middle Temple Murder</i> is one of the prolific <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-s-fletcher">J. S. Fletcher’s</a> most popular works. It builds on his earlier short story “The Contents of the Coffin,” and was published in 1919 as one of three novels he wrote that year. President Woodrow Wilson publicly praised the work, which helped Fletcher earn U.S. acclaim and eventually a publishing deal.</p>

		<summary type="text">Arkady returns to his father’s estate accompanied by his friend from university—a nihilist.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Arkady, a university graduate, returns from <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg to his father’s estate with his mentor Bazarov—a nihilist.</p>
			<p><i>Fathers and Children</i> (also known as <i>Fathers and Sons</i>) is a novel written in 1862 by Russian writer <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ivan-turgenev">Ivan Turgenev</a> and published in Moscow by <i>The Russian Messenger</i>.</p>
			<p>The main theme of the novel is the conflict between two generations—the “fathers,” the liberal serf owners, and the “children,” nihilists who reject their authority and traditions.</p>
			<p>Turgenev’s novel also helped popularize the term “nihilism,” especially after the word’s use by an influential Russian nihilist movement in the 1860s.</p>
			<p>Despite being harshly criticized in Russia, the novel was very well received in Europe, being praised by influential novelists like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-de-maupassant">Guy de Maupassant</a>, making it the first Russian novel to gain recognition in the Western literary world.</p>

		<summary type="text">Hilaire Belloc’s thesis that the capitalist state breeds a collectivist theory which, in action, produces something utterly different from collectivism: the Servile State.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>The Servile State</i>, British-French writer and historian <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hilaire-belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> makes a provocative case that capitalism will inevitably move toward the reestablishment of slavery. The thesis in this book forms the backbone of Belloc’s life-long effort as an advocate for reform to the existing socioeconomic system in the direction of what he terms as “distributism.”</p>
			<p>As a critic of both socialism and capitalism, and a fervent Catholic, Belloc lays out a history of Europe where, over generations, the pagan slavery of the Roman Empire was transformed into a “distributive” model of the Middle Ages. But, he argues, this model was broken by the rise of capitalism in England during the reign of Henry VIII. Ever since, capitalism has been moving ever closer towards the servile state: the restoration of status in the place of contract, and a vast proletariat of wage-earners with few incredibly wealthy owners.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man embarks on a spiritual journey through India.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hermann-hesse">Hermann Hesse</a> wrote <i>Siddhartha</i> during a period in his life in which he suffered what he described as a “sickness with life.” He claimed to be unable to complete the book because he had not experienced the kind of nirvana that Siddhartha, the main character, wants to achieve—so Hesse surrounded himself with sacred Buddhist and Hindu teachings and lived as a recluse in order to complete this work.</p>
			<p><i>Siddhartha</i> is a short, simple tale of a man’s quest to achieve enlightenment and happiness. Over twelve short chapters the reader follows Siddhartha through his time as a young adult, to his exploration of spirituality as a traveling ascetic, to his delvings in lust, business, and greed, to his time as an old man. At each stage of his life Siddhartha yearns for nirvana, finally achieving it only after realizing that it’s all of life’s experiences that form it, not the teachings of any one man.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Siddhartha</i> remains an influential text in new Western spirituality.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young, dying heiress draws people together amid a backdrop of Venetian elegance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Wings of the Dove</i> is perhaps the most well-received of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">Henry James’s</a> novels. First published in 1902, it follows Kate Croy and Merton Densher, an engaged couple in late-Victorian London, who meet Milly Theale, a wealthy American heiress.</p>
			<p>Milly, though young and lively, is burdened with a fatal disease. She wishes to spend her last days on happy adventures through Europe, and her sparkling personality, still bright despite her looming death, quickly makes her a hit in the London social scene. As she plans an excursion to Venice, Kate and Merton, who are too poor to marry and still maintain their social standing, scheme to trick Milly out of her inheritance.</p>
			<p>The character of Milly is partly based on Minny Temple, James’ cousin who died young of tuberculosis. He later wrote that the novel was his attempt to immortalize her memory, and that he spent years developing the core of the book’s conceit before committing it to the page. The novel is James at his peak: dizzyingly complex prose weaves rich, impressionistic character studies, heavy in symbolism and allusion, amid the glamorous backdrops of high-society London and decaying Venetian grandeur.</p>

After their marriage, his wife maintains a close relationship with her father, while their own relationship becomes strained.</p>
			<p>Completed in 1904, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">Henry James</a> himself considered <i>The Golden Bowl</i> one of his best novels, and it remains one of critics’ favorites. Along with <i>The Wings of the Dove</i> and <i>The Ambassadors</i>, the novel represents James’ “major phase,” where he returned to the study of Americans abroad, which dominated his earlier career. The novel focuses almost entirely on four central characters, and explores themes of marriage and adultery in an intricate psychological study, which some critics have even suggested anticipates the style of stream-of-consciousness writing.</p>

		<summary type="text">A poor boy, the son of a servant, rises to fortune on the back of his uncle’s patent-medicine scheme.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Tono-Bungay</i>, published in 1909, is a semi-autobiographical novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a>. Though it has some fantastical and absurdist elements, it is a realist novel rather than one of Well’s “scientific romances.”</p>
			<p>The novel is written in the first person from the point of view of George Ponderevo, the son of the housekeeper at a large estate. He is made to feel his inferiority when he is banished after fighting with the son of one of the owner’s aristocratic relatives, and is sent to live with his own poor but religiously fervent relatives. He can’t abide or agree with their religious views and returns to his mother who sends him on to live with his Uncle, Edward Ponderevo, then a local pharmacist in a small town. Uncle Ponderevo, though, has grand plans, and eventually makes a fortune by selling a quack patent medicine he calls “Tono-Bungay.” George joins him in this endeavour and becomes rich himself, eventually turning his interests towards the new science of aeronautics. Meanwhile the Tono-Bungay scheme expands enormously and begins to topple towards its own destruction.</p>
			<p>Throughout the novel, George comments cynically on England’s class system, the shabbiness of commerce, and the lies told in advertising. We also follow his unfortunate love life, his unwise marriage, his divorce, and his eventual reconnection with a woman he loved as a child.</p>
			<p><i>Tono-Bungay</i> met with a mixed reception on first release, but has since come to be considered as perhaps Wells’ finest realist novel, an assessment Wells himself shared.</p>

		<summary type="text">The lives of two young people are thrown into disarray when their father, the owner of a mill, is bankrupted by an unwise legal dispute.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1860, <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> was the second novel published by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-eliot">George Eliot</a> (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans). Set in the late 1820s or early 1830s, it tells the story of two young people, Tom and Maggie Tulliver, from their childhood into early adulthood. Their father, Jeremy Tulliver, owns Dorlcote Mill on the river Floss, and the children grow to adolescence in relative comfort. However <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tulliver is litigious and initiates an unwise legal suit against a local solicitor, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wakem. The suit is thrown out and the associated costs throw the Tulliver family into poverty, and they lose possession of the mill.</p>
			<p>The main character of the novel is Maggie Tulliver, an intelligent and passionate child and young woman, whose mental, romantic, and moral struggles we follow closely. As in Eliot’s other novels, the author shows a realistic and sympathetic understanding of human behavior.</p>
			<p><i>The Mill on the Floss</i> is regarded as a classic of English literature, and has been made into both a film and a television series.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man with a passion for learning languages is befriended by a group of gypsies and travels Britain, encountering a variety of interesting characters.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lavengro, the Scholar, the Gypsy, the Priest</i>, published in 1851, is a heavily fictionalized account of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-borrow">George Borrow’s</a> early years. Borrow, born in 1803, was a writer and self-taught polyglot, fluent in many European languages, and a lover of literature.</p>
			<p><i>The Romany Rye</i>, published six years later in 1857, is sometimes described as the “sequel” to <i>Lavengro</i>, but in fact it begins with a straight continuation of the action of the first book, which breaks off rather suddenly. The two books therefore are best considered as a whole and read together, and this Standard Ebooks edition combines the two into one volume.</p>
			<p>In the novel Borrow tells of his upbringing as the son of an army recruiting officer, moving with the regiment to different locations in Britain, including Scotland and Ireland. It is in Ireland that he first encounters a strange new language which he is keen to learn, leading to a life-long passion for acquiring new tongues. A couple of years later in England, he comes across a camp of gypsies and meets the gypsy Jasper Petulengro, who becomes a life-long friend. Borrow is delighted to discover that the Romany have their own language, which of course he immediately sets out to learn.</p>
			<p>Borrow’s subsequent life, up to his mid-twenties, is that of a wanderer, traveling from place to place in Britain, encountering many interesting individuals and having a variety of entertaining adventures. He constantly comes in contact with the gypsies and with Petulengro, and becomes familiar with their language and culture.</p>
			<p>The book also includes a considerable amount of criticism of the Catholic Church and its priests. Several chapters are devoted to Borrow’s discussions with “the man in black,” depicted as a cynical Catholic priest who has no real belief in the religious teachings of the Church but who is devoted to seeing it reinstated in England in order for its revenues to increase.</p>
			<p><i>Lavengro</i> was not an immediate critical success on its release, but after Borrow died in 1881, it began to grow in popularity and critical acclaim. It is now considered a classic of English Literature. This Standard Ebooks edition of <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> is based on the editions published by John Murray and edited by W. I. Knapp, with many clarifying notes.</p>

		<summary type="text">An undercover policeman infiltrates a mysterious Anarchist group.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Sometimes described as thrilling, sometimes as comic, and sometimes as metaphysical or spiritual, <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> is perhaps a little of each. The tale begins when an undercover policeman infiltrates a mysterious Anarchist group. As the novel progresses, things become more comic and improbable, and eventually evolve in to a sort of abstract, dreamlike state. Filled with Christian allegory, <i>Thursday</i> is a glittering, fascinating exploration of good versus evil and theology through the lens of adventure, wit, and the surreal.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman just a few inches in height tries to navigate life and relationships following the death of her parents.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/walter-de-la-mare">Walter de la Mare</a> was most famous for his uncanny fiction, and <i>Memoirs of a Midget</i> fits the description perfectly. The protagonist, who we know simply as “M.” or “Midgetina,” is a young woman just a few inches in height—though at times it seems that her height varies. Sometimes she’s small enough to be accosted by birds and carried on trays, and at other times it seems she’s large enough to ride horseback and even pass as a ten-year-old. She trips over hairbrushes, reads books that are larger than her, and must be especially careful around dogs and cats. The people around her seem to take this bizarre state of affairs in stride, and indeed, it’s the only truly uncanny quirk in an otherwise ornate, almost <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">Jamesian</a> narrative.</p>
			<p>The narrative follows Midgetina as she struggles to make her way in life after the tragic death of her parents. Even though she’s minuscule in size, she’s extremely sharp intellectually, taking an interest in literature, astronomy, natural science, and more. Her personality is so distinct that her minuscule stature becomes more of a symbol of her isolation, than the actual cause of it.</p>
			<p>In time she moves in to rooms managed by a Dickensian landlady, whose peripatetic daughter, Fanny, becomes a friend to Midgetina, a possible love interest, and even a sometimes-antagonist. Fanny, a master of manipulation, seems to float through life gleefully and selfishly using those around her. Midgetina, desperate for human connection, clings to Fanny with an interest that at times has an almost erotic edge. Fanny’s subtle manipulations, careless cruelty, and effortless charm make her a character just as memorable as Midgetina, and a powerful antidote to Midgetina’s naive, yearning hopefulness.</p>
			<p>Though largely forgotten today, <i>Memoirs of a Midget</i> was met with high praise from contemporary critics and went on to win the prestigious <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction</a>. Modern critic Edward Wagenknecht regards it as “the greatest English novel of its time.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A promising young man’s life is marred by failure, tragedy, and loss.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Jude the Obscure</i> was first published in its complete form in 1895, just after finishing its serial run in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>. At the time, its unconventional and somewhat scandalous themes earned it widespread criticism and condemnation. In the 1912 “Wessex Edition,” <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-hardy">Hardy</a> appended a postscript to the book’s preface in which he stated that the outrage ultimately abated with no lingering effect other than “completely curing me of further interest in novel-writing.” Indeed, <i>Jude</i> was to be Hardy’s last novel.</p>
			<p>The story chronicles the life of Jude Fawley, an orphan boy of unremarkable birth or means, growing up in the small farming village of Marygreen in Hardy’s fictional version of Wessex, England. From an early age, Jude determines to chart the course of his life by the stars of learning and scholarship, but he very quickly discovers just how little interest the society of his time would take in the grand ambitions of a young man of so humble an origin. Without proper guidance and limited resources, his progress is slow and arduous. And when he discovers the existence of his cousin, the charming Sue Bridehead, it is nearly abandoned altogether in favor of an almost obsessive pursuit.</p>
			<p>The novel proceeds to trace the lives of Jude and Sue as they become locked in a struggle both against themselves and the conventions of their times. Lofty ideals clash with harsh realities; grand pursuits fall prey to darker aspects of human nature. Characters are complex: at times spiteful, selfish, or self-destructive. Hardy, however, remains very subtle in his portrayal of these tragic figures and their flaws. The effect is to render them convincingly human. Ultimately, <i>Jude</i> is an unhappy tale of unfulfilled promise that is rarely told, and rarely told so well.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Cossack uprising in 17th century Poland threatens the entire Commonwealth.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Goodwill in the seventeenth century Polish Commonwealth has been stretched thin due to the nobility’s perceived and real oppression of the less well-off members. When the situation reaches its inevitable breaking point, it sparks the taking up of arms by the Cossacks against the Polish nobility and a spiral of violence that engulfs the entire state. This background provides the canvas for vividly painted narratives of heroism and heartbreak of both the knights and the hetmans swept up in the struggle.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz">Henryk Sienkiewicz</a> had spent most of his adult life as a journalist and editor, but turned his attention back to historical fiction in an attempt to lift the spirits and imbue a sense of nationalism to the partitioned Poland of the nineteenth century. <i>With Fire and Sword</i> is the first of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/the-trilogy">a trilogy of novels</a> dealing with the events of the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the following wars of the late seventeenth century, and weaves fictional characters and events in among historical fact. While there is some contention about the fairness of the portrayal of Polish and Ukrainian belligerents, the novel certainly isn’t one-sided: all factions indulge in brutal violence in an attempt to sway the tide of war, and their grievances are clearly depicted.</p>
			<p>The initial serialization and later publication of the novel proved hugely popular, and in Poland the Trilogy has remained so ever since. In 1999, the novel was the subject of Poland’s then most expensive film, following the previously filmed later books. This edition is based on the 1898 translation by Jeremiah Curtin, who also translated Sienkiewicz’s later (and perhaps more internationally recognized) <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz/quo-vadis/jeremiah-curtin"><i>Quo Vadis</i></a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A brief meditation on depression, philosophy, religion, and the meaning of life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> wrote this short meditation on sadness and the meaning of life when he was middle aged. He had already completed his masterworks, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/anna-karenina/constance-garnett"><i>Anna Karenina</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/war-and-peace/louise-maude_aylmer-maude"><i>War and Peace</i></a>, reared fourteen children, and gained fame and acclaim in Russia as a man of letters. But despite having attained that success, he still found himself unhappy and always returning to the disturbing idea that all achievement is meaningless.</p>
			<p><i>A Confession</i> is his attempt to put these thoughts in words as he teetered on the brink of suicide. It forms the first in a four-volume series that included <i>A Criticism of Dogmatic Theology</i>, <i>The Gospel in Brief</i>, and <i>What I Believe</i> (also known as <i>My Religion</i> or <i>My Faith</i>).</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man abandons his dream of playing cricket at Cambridge because of financial trouble and goes to work for a London bank, where he’s joined by an unflappable friend.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Mike Jackson is a rising cricket star who finds his dreams of studying and playing at Cambridge upset by news of his father’s financial troubles.

		<summary type="text">A domestic satire set in England before the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Vanity Fair</i> is perhaps <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-makepeace-thackeray">Thackeray’s</a> most famous novel. First serialized over the course of 19 volumes in <i>Punch Magazine</i> and first printed as a single volume in 1849, the novel cemented Thackeray’s literary fame and kept him busy with frequent revisions and even lecture circuits.</p>
			<p>The story is framed as a puppet play, narrated by an unreliable narrator, that presents the story of Becky Sharp and Emmy Sedley and the people in their lives as they struggle through the Napoleonic Wars. The story itself, like many other Thackeray novels, is a satire of the lives of the Victorian English of a certain class. Thackeray packed the novel with allusions, many of which were difficult even for his contemporary readers; part of the heavy revisions he later made were making the allusions more accessible to his evolving audience.</p>
			<p>As part of his satirical bent, Thackeray made a point to make each character flawed, so that there are no “heroes” in the book—hence the subtitle “A Novel Without a Hero.” Thackeray’s goal was not only to entertain, but to instruct; to that end, he wanted the reader to look within themselves after finishing the unhappy conclusion, in which there’s no hint as to how society might be able to improve on the evils shadowed in the events of novel.</p>
			<p><i>Vanity Fair</i> received glowing praise by its critical contemporaries, and remains a popular book well into modern times, having been adapted repeatedly for film, radio, and television.</p>

		<summary type="text">The legendary hero Aeneas flees the city of Troy with his father and young son, and travels to Italy to become the ancestor of the Romans.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virgil">Virgil’s</a> epic poem begins with Aeneas fleeing the ruins of Troy with his father Anchises and his young son Ascanius, with a plan to make a home in Italy. Because of a prophecy foretelling that the descendants of Aeneas will one day destroy Carthage, Juno’s favorite city, Juno orders the god of the winds to unleash a terrible storm. The ships are thrown off course and arrive at an African port. As Aeneas makes his way towards his new home he encounters Dido, Carthage’s queen, and falls deeply in love.</p>
			<p>Although Charles W. Elliot stated that “the modern appreciation of the <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-iliad/william-cullen-bryant">Iliad</a></i> and the <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey/william-cullen-bryant">Odyssey</a></i> has tended to carry with it a depreciation of the <i>Aeneid</i>,” this epic poem continues to inspire artists, writers, and musicians centuries after its first telling. John Dryden’s translation captures the musicality of the original Latin verses while avoiding the stumbling of an English translation forced into dactylic hexameter.</p>

		<summary type="text">An American classicist collects and explains myths and legends ranging from those of the ancient Greeks and Romans, through stories of King Arthur, to the legends of Charlemagne.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-bulfinch">Thomas Bulfinch</a> was an American banker and Latin scholar. <i>Bulfinch’s Mythology</i> is a posthumous compilation of three volumes published by Bulfinch during his lifetime which were intended to introduce the general reader to the myths and legends of Western Civilization by presenting them in simple prose with occasional commentary by the author. Bulfinch also includes many quotations showing how these stories have been handled by poets and playwrights of later years.</p>
			<p>The three original volumes are <i>The Age of Fable</i> (1855), dealing largely with Greek and Roman mythology but also touching on the mythology of other cultures such as the Indian, Egyptian and Norse myths; <i>The Age of Chivalry</i> (1858), dealing with Arthurian legend, the Holy Grail and the Mabinogeon; and <i>Legends of Charlemagne</i> (1863), dealing with the fantastical legends surrounding Charlemagne and his “paladins” such as Orlando, Oliver and Rogero.</p>
			<p>The combined volume entitled <i>Bulfinch’s Mythology</i> quickly became very popular, and by some accounts it is one of the most popular books ever published in the United States.</p>

		<summary type="text">The account of a free black man kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery, from which it took twelve years to free himself.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1841, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/solomon-northup">Solomon Northup</a> was a free black man, married with three children and living in upstate New York, when he was tricked into going to Washington DC. There, he was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery, eventually ending up on a plantation in the Red River area of Louisiana. For twelve years he experienced and witnessed the arbitrary beatings and whippings, around-the-clock back-breaking work, and countless other degradations that came with being enslaved in the antebellum south. Through the sympathetic ear of a white man and with miraculous timing, he was eventually freed and returned home. He then wrote this memoir and contributed to the abolitionist movement before disappearing from the pages of history.</p>
			<p>Like <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/linda-brent/incidents-in-the-life-of-a-slave-girl">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</a></i>, <i>Twelve Years a Slave</i> stands in stark contrast to the era’s bucolic propaganda that the enslaved in the south were well treated, well provided for, and made “part of the family.” As a first-hand account, it exposes slavery for what it is: barbaric, dehumanizing, and evil.</p>

		<summary type="text">A knight and his squire set forth for adventure and love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The knight-errant Hudibras and his trusty (and somewhat more grounded) squire Ralph roam the land in search of adventure and love. Never the most congenial of partners, their constant arguments are <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-butler-1612-1680">Samuel Butler’s</a> satire of the major issues of the day in late 17th century Britain, including the recent civil war, religious sectarianism, philosophy, astrology, and even the differing rights of women and men.</p>
			<p>Butler had originally studied to be a lawyer (which explains some of the detail in the third part of <i>Hudibras</i>), but made a living variously as a clerk, part-time painter, and secretary before dedicating himself to writing in 1662. <i>Hudibras</i> was immediately popular on the release of its first part, and, like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/miguel-de-cervantes-saavedra/don-quixote/john-ormsby"><i>Don Quixote</i></a>, even had an unauthorized second part available before Butler had finished the genuine one. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltaire">Voltaire</a> praised the humor, and although <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> wasn’t immediately taken with the poem, it was such the rage that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-pepys/the-diary/text/chapter-38#entry-1663-2-16">he noted in his diary</a> that he’d repurchased it to see again what the fuss was about. <i>Hudibras</i>’s popularity did not fade for many years, and although some of the finer detail of 17th century talking points might be lost on the modern reader, the wit of the caricatures (and a large collection of endnotes) help bring this story to life.</p>

		<summary type="text">Phillis Wheatley’s only published collection of poetry.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral</i> was the first book of poetry ever published by an African-American author. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/phillis-wheatley">Phillis Wheatley’s</a> deep familiarity with Latin literature and Christianity, combined with her African ancestry, provided her with a unique and inimitable view of poetry.</p>
			<p>She was kidnapped and brought over to America on a ship called <i>The Phillis</i> after which she was named. Her interest in poetry and literature was recognized by the Wheatley family who, though keeping her enslaved, provided her with classic works of literature by authors such as Virgil, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer">Homer</a>, Terence, and Pope, all of whom had a significant influence on her work.</p>
			<p>She received praise from many of her contemporaries including George Washington, John Hancock, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltaire">Voltaire</a>. Shortly after publishing her collection of poetry she was emancipated by the Wheatley family. Even so, her life ended in poverty and obscurity.</p>
			<p>Though her influence on poetry and African-American literature is indisputable, more modern critics of her work point to the lack of censure of slavery and the absence of discussion about the lives of black people in the United States as an example of the Uncle Tom syndrome.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of poems by John Henry Newman.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Verses on Various Occasions</i> is a collection of poems written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-henry-newman">John Henry Newman</a> between 1818 and 1865. This period of Newman’s ecclesiastical career saw his ordination as an Anglican priest in 1825, his involvement in the High Church “Oxford Movement” in the 1830s, his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1845, and his founding of the Birmingham Oratory, a Catholic religious community, in 1849.</p>
			<p>The poems in this collection span a range of Christian subjects, including piety, biblical prophets, Church Fathers, and Newman’s evolving views on the Catholic Church. Some noteworthy inclusions are “The Pillar of the Cloud,” which has been set to music as the hymn “Lead, Kindly Light,” and “The Dream of Gerontius,” which relates a man’s journey into the afterlife, inspired by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dante-alighieri">Dante’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dante-alighieri/the-divine-comedy/henry-wadsworth-longfellow"><i>Divine Comedy</i></a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">An allegorical story of a pilgrim in search of redemption, followed later by his wife and children, passing through great trials before reaching the Celestial City.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Pilgrim’s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come</i> was written in 1678 by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-bunyan">John Bunyan</a>, a Puritan and a dissenter from the Church of England. It is an allegory of the journey to redemption of the faithful, through many snares and difficulties. Cast in the form of a dream, the first part of the work deals with a man called Christian, who sets off carrying a great burden. He meets many helpers and many adversaries on this journey. The second part of the work deals with Christian’s wife, Christiana, and her four children, who follow a similar journey.</p>
			<p>One of the most influential of all religious works, <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i> was immediately popular and has been translated over the years into many languages and into many forms, including verse, opera, movies, and many illustrated versions for children. Several of its story elements, characters and locations have entered the language, such as the “Slough of Despond,” “Vanity Fair,” “Great-heart,” and “Giant Despair.”</p>
			<p>This edition is based on a version of Bunyan’s complete works edited by George Offor and published in 1855. It contains many endnotes drawn from a variety of commentators.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Gothic tale of chivalry, romance, and horror.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Castle of Otranto</i> is considered to be the first “Gothic” novel—that is, containing a combination of tropes, like hidden passages, haunted paintings, mysterious sounds, skeletal ghosts, ancestral curses, and unexplained deaths, that essentially invented the genre later made famous by authors like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker">Bram Stoker</a>, or <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">Henry James</a>. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/horace-walpole">Walpole</a> made a point of creating a novel that blends supernatural elements with more realistic depictions of characters and events.</p>
			<p>The plot centers around Manfred, the lord of Otranto Castle, who has just witnessed the death of his son under mysterious circumstances, just as his son was about to be married. Manfred is thrust into a galloping and melodramatic series of events that lean heavily on the supernatural.</p>
			<p>Walpole initially published <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> under a pseudonym, claiming that his work was a translation of an ancient Italian manuscript. This framing, along with the purposely archaic writing style, gives the supernatural airs of the novel a decidedly authentic flavor. In later editions Walpole acknowledges his authorship.</p>
			<p><i>Otranto</i> remains a fast-paced and familiar read, thanks to the variety of recognizable tropes it introduced and made popular.</p>

		<summary type="text">Captain Ahab, having lost his leg to the white whale Moby Dick, travels the world on a quest for vengeance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“Call me Ishmael” says <i>Moby Dick</i>’s protagonist, and with this famous first line launches one of the acclaimed great American novels. Part adventure story, part quest for vengeance, part biological textbook and part whaling manual, <i>Moby Dick</i> was first published in 1851. The story follows Ishmael as he abandons his humdrum life on shore for an adventure on the waves. Finding the whaler <i>Pequod</i> at harbour in Nantucket, he signs up for a three year term without meeting the Captain of the ship, a mysterious figure called Ahab. It is only well into the voyage that Ahab’s thirst for vengeance against the eponymous white whale Moby Dick—and the consequences—become clear.</p>
			<p>The novel is semi-autobiographical: <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville">Herman Melville</a> had had his own experience of whaling, having spent a year and a half aboard a whaling ship and further years travelling the world in the early 1840s. Herman used the knowledge gained from his experiences and wide reading on the subject to furnish <i>Moby Dick</i> with an almost encyclopaedic quality at times. The literary style varies widely, veering from soliloquies and staged scenes to dream sequences to comprehensive lists of ships provisions, but everything serves to further detail the world that’s being painted.</p>
			<p>Presented here is the New York edition, which was published later than the London edition and reverted numerous changes the original publishers had made, as well as including the initially omitted epilogue.</p>

		<summary type="text">The complete U.S. public domain short fiction of horror legend H. P. Lovecraft.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft">Howard Phillips Lovecraft</a> was one of the most influential writers of horror fiction in the early 20th century. His fame is mostly posthumous: he was only published in pulp magazines in his lifetime, and never saw financial success. Despite that, Lovecraft’s unique blend of gothicism, horror, and the supernatural, set in an imagined but eerily-real New England, marked a gold standard for horror fiction for decades after his death.</p>
			<p>Readers of modern fantasy and horror fiction will certainly recognize Cthulhu, the tentacle-mouthed god who lies asleep in a sunken Atlantean ruin; the <i>Necronomicon</i>, a grimoire of unspeakable power and horror penned by the “mad Arab” Abdul Alhazred; and the dark, twisted New England countryside of the Miskatonic Valley. These and other features take shape in Lovecraft’s stories, creating a backdrop of the bizarre and evil behind seemingly day-to-day lives. A thread of cosmic horror soon turns anything normal towards madness.</p>
			<p>This edition is small because verifying the U.S. public domain status of Lovecraft’s corpus is a difficult, if not impossible, academic exercise, and finding first-edition copies to transcribe is also difficult. This edition will be updated as more transcriptions become verified and available.</p>
			<p>Included in this edition are some of Lovecraft’s juvenalia—in particular, “The Alchemist” was written when he was just seventeen or eighteen.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of writers try to hold on to artistic merit in the face of abject poverty in the quickly-changing literary and social landscape of Victorian London.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Grub Street is the name of a former street in London synonymous with pulp writers and low-quality publishers. <i>New Grub Street</i> takes its name from that old street, as it follows the lives and endeavors of a group of writers active in the literary scene of 1880s London.</p>
			<p>Edwin Reardon is a quiet and intelligent writer whose artistic sensibilities are the opposite of what the London public wants to read. He’s forced to write long, joyless novels that he thinks pop publishers will want to buy. These novels are draining to write, yet result in meager sales; soon Edwin’s increasingly small bank account, and his stubborn pride, start to put a strain on his once-happy marriage.</p>
			<p>His best friend, Biffen, lies to one side of Edwin’s nature: as another highly-educated writer, he accepts a dingy, lonely, and hungry life of abject poverty in exchange for being able to produce a novel that’s true to his artistic desires but is unlikely to sell. On the other side lies Jasper Milvain, an “alarmingly modern” writer laser-focused on earning as much money as possible no matter what he’s made to write, as he floats through the same literary circles that Edwin haunts.</p>
			<p>The intricately-told tale follows these writers as their differing outlooks and their fluctuating ranks in society affect them and the people around them. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-gissing">Gissing</a>, himself a prolific writer intimately familiar with the London literary scene, draws from his own life in laying out the characters and events in the novel. He carefully elaborates the fragile social fabric of the literary world, its paupers and its barons both equal in the industry but unequal in public life. Though the novel is about writers on the face, the deep thread that runs through it all is the brutality of the modern social structure, where the greedy and superficial are rewarded with stability and riches, while the delicate and thoughtful are condemned to live on the margins of respectable society in grimy poverty, robbed not only of dignity, but of love.</p>

		<summary type="text">Seven women and three men each tell a story a day for ten days while sheltering to avoid the black plague.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the time of a devastating pandemic, seven women and three men withdraw to a country estate outside Florence to give themselves a diversion from the death around them. Once there, they decide to spend some time each day telling stories, each of the ten to tell one story each day. They do this for ten days, with a few other days of rest in between, resulting in the 100 stories of the <i>Decameron</i>.</p>
			<p>The <i>Decameron</i> was written after the Black Plague spread through Italy in 1348. Most of the tales did not originate with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/giovanni-boccaccio">Boccaccio</a>; some of them were centuries old already in his time, but Boccaccio imbued them all with his distinctive style. The stories run the gamut from tragedy to comedy, from lewd to inspiring, and sometimes all of those at once. They also provide a detailed picture of daily life in fourteenth-century Italy.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mad knight-errant and his down-to-earth squire encounter adventure in the Spanish countryside.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Don Quixote</i> is a novel that doesn’t need much introduction. Not only is it widely considered the greatest Spanish literary work of all time, one of the greatest literary works in history, and a cornerstone of the Western literary canon, it’s also considered one of the first—if not <em>the</em> first—modern novels.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is believed to be the first ebook edition of <i>Don Quixote</i> to feature a full transcription of translator John Ormsby’s nearly 1,000 footnotes. Ormsby as an annotator deftly explains obscure passages, gives background on the life and times of 1600s Spain, references decisions from other contemporary translators, and doesn’t hold back from sharing his views on the genius—and flaws—of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/miguel-de-cervantes-saavedra">Cervantes’</a> greatest work.</p>
			<p>The story is of the eponymous Don Quixote, a country noble who, in his old age, reads too many chivalric romances and goes mad. After convincing his grubby servant, Sancho Panza, to join him as his squire, he embarks on an absurd and comic quest to do good and right wrongs.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Don Quixote</i>’s two volumes are published as a single work, but their publication came ten years apart. Cervantes saw great success with the publication of his first volume, and appeared to have little desire to write a second volume until a different author wrote a spurious, inferior sequel. This kicked Cervantes into gear and he wrote volume two, a more serious and philosophical volume than the largely comic first volume.</p>
			<p>Despite being written in 1605 and translated in 1885, <i>Don Quixote</i> contains a surprising amount of slapstick laughs—even for the modern reader—and narrative devices still seen in today’s fiction, including meta-narratives, frame narratives, and metafiction. Many scenes (like Quixote’s attack on the windmills) and characters (like Sancho Panza and Lothario) are so famous that they’re ingrained in our collective culture.</p>

		<summary type="text">Ten mathematical puzzles presented as comedic short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the late 19th century, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>—better known these days as the author of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll/alices-adventures-in-wonderland/john-tenniel"><i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i></a>—was also an established mathematician who had published many books and papers in the fields of algebra and logic. His mathematical interest extended to the setting of puzzles for popular consumption. The stories collected here cover varied subjects including the cataloguing of paintings, the number of times trains will pass each other on a circular track, the most efficient way to rent individual rooms on a square, and many more. They were published originally in <i>The Monthly Packet</i> magazine and then collected with some additional commentary into a book originally published in 1885. Included along with the stories is a full appendix with Carroll’s answers, and his often acerbic commentary on the answers submitted to him at the time.</p>

		<summary type="text">A philosopher and political activist presents a forceful argument in favor of the principles of the French Revolution and of republicanism in general, together with a condemnation of monarchy and hereditary power in general.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-paine">Thomas Paine</a> wrote the first part of <i>The Rights of Man</i> in 1791 as a response to the furious attack on the French Revolution by the British parliamentarian Edmund Burke in his pamphlet <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>, published the previous year. Paine carefully dissects and counters Burke’s arguments and provides a more accurate description of the events surrounding the revolution of 1789. He then reproduces and comments on the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens” promulgated by the National Assembly of France.</p>
			<p>The manuscript of <i>The Rights of Man</i> was placed with the publisher Joseph Johnson, but that publisher was threatened with legal action by the British Government. Paine then gave the work to another publisher, J. S. Jordan, and on the advice of William Blake, Paine went to France to be out of the way of possible arrest in Britain. <i>The Rights of Man</i> was published in March 1791, and was an immediate success with the British public, selling nearly a million copies.</p>
			<p>A second part of the book, subtitled “Combining Principle and Practice,” was published in February 1792. It puts forward practical proposals for the establishment of republican government in countries like Britain.</p>
			<p><i>The Rights of Man</i> had a major impact, leading to the establishment of a number of reform societies. After the publication of the second part of the book, Paine and his publisher were charged with seditious libel, and Paine was eventually forced to leave Britain and flee to France. Today <i>The Rights of Man</i> is considered a classic of political writing and philosophy.</p>

		<summary type="text">A comic parody of the gothic movement in early nineteenth-century British literature.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1818, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-love-peacock">Peacock’s</a> novella <i>Nightmare Abbey</i> is a gentle satire of the then-popular gothic movement in literature. He pokes fun at the genre’s obsessions and most of the book’s characters are caricatures of well-known personages of the time.</p>
			<p>Young Scythrop is the only son of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry, living in the semi-ruined Nightmare Abbey on his estate in Lincolnshire. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry, the survivor of a miserable marriage, is addicted to the depressing and the morbid, surrounding himself with servants whose names, such as Raven, Graves and Skellet, reflect his obsessions. His friends, also, are chosen from those who best reflect his misanthropic views.</p>
			<p>Scythrop himself imagines himself a philosopher with a unique view of the world, and to this end has written a treatise titled “Philosophical Gas; or, a Project for a General Illumination of the Human Mind.” Only seven copies of this treatise have ever been sold, and Scythrop dreams of being united with one of the buyers. His passions, though, become more earthy when he falls in love both with his cousin Marionetta and then also with a mysterious woman who appears in his apartment and begs him for asylum, thus creating a situation of romantic farce as he tries to decide between the two.</p>
			<p>These events are interleaved between entertaining discussions among the varied guests at Nightmare Abbey, richly filled with humor, allusions and quotation.</p>
			<p><i>Nightmare Abbey</i> is probably Peacock’s most successful work of fiction, and helped establish his position as an important satirist of his times. His satire, though, is light-hearted rather than savage and is directed more at foolish opinions than attacking particular persons.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young woman of poor and uneducated parents is driven by guilt to try to redeem her family’s fortunes.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</i> is said to be <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-hardy">Thomas Hardy’s</a> fictional masterpiece and is considered to be an important nineteenth century novel. It explores themes of love, sex, class and morality in an aching love story.</p>
			<p>It initially appeared in a censored, serialised version in <i>The Graphic</i> in 1891 and was published in a single volume the following year. Early reviews were mixed, partly because of its challenge to Victorian sexual morals—it is now looked upon much more favorably.</p>
			<p>Tess Durbeyfield is the oldest child of uneducated peasants who are given the impression that they may have noble blood, as their surname is a corruption of that of an extinct Norman family. When Tess participates in the village May Dance, she meets Angel, who stops to join the dance but notices Tess too late to dance with her. That night, Tess’s father gets too drunk to drive to the market, so she undertakes the journey herself. However, she falls asleep at the reins, and the family’s only horse encounters a speeding wagon and is fatally wounded. Tess feels so guilty over the consequences for the family that she agrees to try to claim kin with a rich widow who lives in a neighbouring town. The story traces Tess’s life through the following years.</p>
			<p>The novel has been adapted for the stage, theatre, opera, cinema and television numerous times since its publication.</p>

		<summary type="text">The legendary Baron Munchausen’s tall tales of wonder and adventure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Baron Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen, was an actual baron living in 18th-century Hanover famous for entertaining his guests with outrageously-embellished tales of his wartime exploits—so much so that his nickname in German is <i>Lügenbaron</i>, or “Baron of Lies.” When <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudolph-erich-raspe">Rudolph Eric Raspe</a>, a writer and scientist living in England, heard of the Baron’s tales, he wrote his own versions centered around a fictional Baron Munchausen.</p>
			<p>While the real Baron wasn’t amused to have his name attached to a silly character famous for his bald-faced lies, Raspe’s tales became hugely popular, reprinted for hundreds of years and illustrated just as many times. These very short tales were originally intended as contemporary satire, but their outrageous silliness is still entertaining today.</p>

		<summary type="text">Psmith, visiting New York with Mike on a cricket tour, finds entertainment and trouble for himself in the newspaper business, stirring up trouble with New York’s notorious gangs.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Growing bored while accompanying his Cambridge chum Mike on a cricket tour of the United States, Psmith seeks adventure in New York City. He finds it in the form of the weekly newspaper <i>Cosy Moments</i>, a completely bland and inoffensive publication at which, through charm and sheer force of personality, Psmith appoints himself an unpaid subeditor, fires the entire contributing staff, and embarks on a crusade against the slumlords, gangs, and boxing managers of his holiday destination.</p>
			<p><i>Psmith, Journalist</i> is the second of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse">Wodehouse’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/psmith">Psmith novels</a>, and is a marked departure from the author’s usual settings and themes. It presents a very strong social justice theme with direct, harsh condemnation of exploitation, corruption, racism, and inequality in early-twentieth century America, and its themes continue to resonate with readers a century later.</p>
			<p>The story first appeared in <i>The Captain</i> magazine from October 1909 to February 1910, and was first published as a book, including eight illustrations, by A &amp; C Black in 1915. This Standard Ebook is based on the 1923 edition by the same publisher.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of satirical essays ridiculing pretentiousness through imitation.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Works of Max Beerbohm</i> is a collection of satirical essays by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/max-beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a>. It was published in 1896 at The Bodley Head, his publisher John Lane contributing a detailed bibliography of the works of the author, then aged 24. Before their publication as a book, the essays had appeared in prominent literary periodicals such as <i>The Yellow Book</i> and <i>The Savoy</i>. Most of the essays were written while he was a student at Oxford, although he had left Merton College in 1894. By then he was already known as a caricaturist, parodist and essayist and well acquainted with the writers and artists connected with The Bodley Head, notably Aubrey Beardsley and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>.</p>
			<p>The essays can perhaps be best described as both elaborate parody and vicious satire. Beerbohm’s intimate knowledge of the social circles of the time and his penchant for pointed descriptions of character are always on display, dismantling the purported greatness that surrounds him.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Victorian dandy turns to a life of debauchery after a magical portrait stops him from aging.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was first published as a serial in <i>Lippencott’s Monthly Magazine</i>, and the publishers thought it would so offend readers that they removed nearly 500 words without <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Wilde’s</a> approval. Wilde soon expanded it and republished it as a novel, including a short preface justifying his art. Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, <i>Dorian Gray</i> today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives. Couched in Wilde’s trademark cutting wit, <i>Dorian Gray</i> is still being adapted today, with Dorian and his moldering portrait remaining cultural touchstones.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Oscar Wilde’s short mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>This collection of short “mystery” stories by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> was originally published in 1891 and was his second published collection of stories. This edition follows the 1907 edition, which was published after his death and added “The Portrait of Mr. W. H.,” a story first published in 1899.</p>
			<p>Written around the same time as <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde/the-picture-of-dorian-gray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></i> and before he turned his hand to playwriting, these stories showcase the quintessential Wilde: dark irony combined with an incisive dissection of Victorian society, with just a hint of the supernatural added to amuse and engage his Victorian audience.</p>

		<summary type="text">A middle-aged man in early Edwardian England finds himself despairing at his failed business and marriage, and takes a drastic step to escape—with unexpected results.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>This work by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a> was first published in 1910. In contrast to Wells’ early speculative fiction works like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-time-machine"><i>The Time Machine</i></a>, this is a comic novel set in the everyday world of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era in England. Despite the less than happy life-story of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly, it is an amusing book, enlivened by Polly’s inventive attitude towards the English language.</p>
			<p>Alfred Polly’s mother dies when he is only seven, and he is brought up by his father and a stern aunt. He is indifferently educated, and leaves school in his early teens to be employed as a draper’s assistant. As the years pass, he finds himself more and more disenchanted with his occupation, but it is too late to change it. Eventually his father dies and leaves him a legacy which may be enough to set up in business for himself. He sets up his own shop in a small town and stumbles into an unhappy marriage. The business is not profitable, and in his middle-age, unhappy and dyspeptic, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly comes up with an idea to bring an end to his troubles. Things, however, do not go as he planned, and lead to an unexpected result.</p>
			<p>Wells’ later work often displays his passion for social reform. Here, that passion is less obvious, but nevertheless he demonstrates his sympathy for middle-class people raised like <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly with but a poor education and trapped into either dead-end jobs or in failing retail businesses.</p>
			<p><i>The History of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly</i> was well-received by critics at the time of publication and was subsequently made into both a film and two different <abbr>BBC</abbr> television serials.</p>

		<summary type="text">An orphan raised by his aunt and uncle struggles as a young man to integrate into upper class society after receiving a substantial inheritance from his grandfather.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Kipps</i> is the story of Arthur “Artie” Kipps, an illegitimate orphan raised by his aunt and uncle on the southern coast of England in the town of New Romney. Kipps falls in love with neighbor friend Ann Pornick but soon loses touch with her as he begins an apprenticeship at a drapery establishment in the port town of Folkestone. After a drunken evening with his new friend Chitterlow, an aspiring playwright, Kipps discovers he is to inherit a house and sizable income from his grandfather. Kipps then struggles to understand what his new-found wealth means in terms of his place in society and his love life.</p>
			<p>While today <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a> is best known for his “scientific romances” such as <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-time-machine">The Time Machine</a></i> and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-island-of-doctor-moreau">The Island of Doctor Moreau</a></i>, Wells considered <i>Kipps</i> his favorite work. Wells worked closely with (some say pestered) his publisher Macmillan to employ creative promotional schemes, and thanks to a cheap edition sales blossomed to over 200,000 during the first two decades of publication. It was during this period that his prior futuristic works became more available and popular with American audiences.</p>

		<summary type="text">Thoreau’s report on his social experiment of solitude, simplicity, and self-reliance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Walden</i> is one of the more famous transcendentalist tracts in modern American literature. First published in 1854, <i>Walden</i> is an account of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-david-thoreau">Thoreau’s</a> famous experiment in solitude: spending over two years alone in a cabin near the wilderness.</p>
			<p><i>Walden</i> is broken into sections that meditate on single themes: economy, reading, sounds, solitude, visitors, and so on. The style is complex, weaving back and forth between simple, home-spun prose and complex allegory, metaphor, and allusion. This makes <i>Walden</i> an interesting read because while it may seem accessible on the surface, it’s a book that requires deep and repeated reading to fully appreciate its many complexities.</p>

		<summary type="text">Mill’s famous essay that applies a utilitarian ethical system to systems of government.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill">John Stuart Mill</a> was a prolific and well-regarded author and philosopher in his day, but perhaps his most enduring work is <i>On Liberty</i>, an essay developed over several years and with significant input from his wife. In it, he applies his views on the Utilitarian ethical theory to systems of society and governance. The result became one of the most influential essays on liberal political thought in modern history.</p>
			<p>In <i>On Liberty</i> Mill addresses such familiar concepts as freedom of speech, the importance of individuality, and the limits of society’s influence on the individual. He caps the discussion with an application of these principles to problems of the day, including education and the economy.</p>

		<summary type="text">The autobiographical story of Joyce’s youth in Ireland and his escaping the country’s conformity and mediocrity to blossom as a writer on the continent.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">Joyce’s</a> first novel, published after the previous success of his short story collection <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce/dubliners">Dubliners</a></i>. The novel is written in a modernist style, with dialog and narration blending together in a kind of stream-of-consciousness meant to invoke the blurriness of memory.</p>
			<p>Joyce originally planned writing a realist autobiographical novel of 63 chapters titled <i>Stephen Hero</i>. He abandoned the attempt halfway through, and refocused his efforts on <i>Portrait</i>, a shorter, sharper work in the modernist style. His alter-ego remained Stephen Dedalus, named after Daedalus, the mythological Greek craftsman and father of Icarus. <i>Portrait</i> was written while he was waiting for <i>Dubliners</i> to be published, a process that took eight years and so frustrated Joyce that he once threw the manuscript of <i>Portrait</i> into a fire, causing his family to run to save it.</p>
			<p>The novel closely traces Joyce’s early years. Like his alter-ego Stephen, Joyce was born into a middle-class family and lived in Dublin as they descended into poverty; he rebelled against his Irish Catholic upbringing to become a star student at Dublin University, and put aside thoughts of priesthood or medicine, the other careers offered him, to become a writer. Joyce doesn’t shy away from sensitive topics, presenting the discoveries of youth in all of their physical detail, including Stephen’s teenage visits to prostitutes (which also mirror Joyce’s youth, and were how he probably contracted the suspected syphilis that plagued his vision and tortured his health for the rest of his life), and the homosexual explorations of children at a Jesuit school.</p>
			<p>The writing is in the free indirect style, allowing the narrator to both focus on Stephen and present characters and events through his eyes, until the last chapter, where Stephen’s first-person diary entries suggest he’s finally found his voice. As the novel progresses, the syntax and vocabulary also grow in complexity, reflecting Stephen’s own development.</p>
			<p>Of Joyce’s three novels, <i>Portrait</i> is the most straightforward and accessible. But it remains just as rich and complex as any masterpiece, with critics across generations hailing it as work of unique beauty and perception.</p>

		<summary type="text">The tale of to what extent a woman’s love is worth pursuing.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Domnei</i> by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-branch-cabell">James Branch Cabell</a> is the fourth installment in his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/biography-of-the-life-of-manuel">Biography of the Life of Manuel</a> series, which follows the lives of Dom Manuel and his descendants in the fictional French county of Poictesme.</p>
			<p>It was initially published as <i>The Soul of Melicent</i> in 1913 under the erroneous advice of Cabell’s publisher, who suggested that the title would help sell more copies. But only 493 copies were sold of the original print run. In 1920 the book was republished as <i>Domnei: A Comedy of Woman-Worship</i>, Cabell’s original vision for the title.</p>
			<p>The story follows Perion de la Forêt, fugitive leader of a mercenary troop, and his unbridled passion for his newly-wed and newly-distant lover, the Princess Melicent, daughter of Dom Manuel. The tale takes us to many locations in Middle-Ages Europe as we witness to what extent men will go to pursue a woman’s love.</p>

		<summary type="text">An explanation on why increased productivity has not led to increased wages, and how the application of a single land value tax can fix this and lead to a more just society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Progress and Poverty</i>, first published in 1879, was American political economist <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-george">Henry George’s</a> most popular book. It explores why the economy of the mid-to-late 1800s had seen a simultaneous economic growth and growth in poverty. The book’s appeal was in its balance of moral and economic arguments, challenging the popular notion that the poor, through uncontrolled population growth, were responsible for their own woes. Inspired by his years living in San Francisco and his own experience with privation, George argues instead that poverty had grown due to the increasing speculation and monopolization of land, as landowners had captured the increases in growth, investment, and productivity through the rising cost of rent.</p>
			<p>To solve this, George proposes the complete taxation of the unimproved value of land, thus returning the value of land, created through location, to the community. This solution would incentivize individuals to use the land they own productively and remove the tendency to speculate upon land’s increasing value. George’s argument was profoundly liberal, as individuals retain the right to own land and enjoy the profits generated from production upon it.</p>
			<p><i>Progress and Poverty</i> was hugely popular in the 1890s, being outsold only by the Bible. It inspired the Single Tax Movement, and influenced a wide range of intellectuals and policymakers in the early 1900s including <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, Albert Einstein, and Winston Churchill.</p>

			<p><i>The Secret City</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hugh-walpole">Walpole’s</a> sequel to his earlier book about Russian life, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hugh-walpole/the-dark-forest"><i>The Dark Forest</i></a>. John Durward, the English protagonist from that book and a semi-autobiographical stand-in for Walpole, is visiting St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) when he runs in to some old friends from England. Through them he meets Vera and Nina, two young and bourgeois sisters, and Nicolai Markovitch, a downtrodden and ridiculous inventor. Semyonov, a brooding doctor who is the sisters’ uncle and a character from <i>The Dark Forest</i>, returns as a dark, viperous thread weaving through the story.</p>
			<p>Durward narrates the lives of these bourgeois Russians as they love each other and fight amongst themselves in equal measure. But as they obliviously carry on their cozy, lamp-lit lives, the Russian Revolution breaks out around them. St. Petersburg quickly changes from a comfortable, elegant, and gently mysterious city to a bloody and cold scar across the face of civilization. As the air fills with the sound of gunfire and the smell of smoke and soot, Durward and his English and Russian friends become a microcosm of the chaos they find themselves engulfed in.</p>
			<p>Walpole lived some years in Russia during the Revolution, working as a journalist, then at the Russian Red Cross, and later as the Head of British Propaganda in St. Petersburg. His intimate knowledge of both the city and of the turbulent early days of the Revolution give <i>The Secret City</i> a more than convincing air. It’s the first book to have won the prestigious <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction</a>, and is considered to be Walpole’s most delicate and insightful work.</p>

		<summary type="text">On a rowboat excursion with his brother, Thoreau lets his thoughts meander with the river.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In 1839, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-david-thoreau">Thoreau</a> and his brother took a small boat upriver and back. Some years later, while in his cabin at Walden Pond, he gathered his notes from that journey and other writings from his journals, and composed this, his first book.</p>
			<p>Like the rivers it describes, the book meanders through varying territories and climates. He writes of the natural surroundings they encounter and of the history of the region, but also takes long and remarkable detours through topics like friendship, history, a comparison of Christianity and Hinduism, Vedic literature, government and conscience, Thoreau’s philosophy of literature, monuments and graveyards, poetry (in particular Ossian, Chaucer, and certain minor Greek poets), and the satires of Aulus Persius Flaccus. Thoreau also includes several poems of his own.</p>
			<p>Thoreau had the first edition of this book published at his own expense, and at first it struggled to find an audience. “I have now a library of nearly 900 volumes,” he remarked at one point, “over 700 of which I wrote myself.”</p>

		<summary type="text">After her husband is wrongly convicted of murder, a young Sardinian woman driven into poverty is forced to divorce him and marry a wealthy but abusive man in order to survive.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Giovanna and Costantino Ledda are a happily married young Sardinian couple living a contented village existence with their small child and extended family. But after Costantino is wrongly convicted of murdering his uncle and imprisoned, the now‐impoverished Giovanna reluctantly divorces him under a newly enacted divorce law and marries Brontu Dejas, a wealthy but cruel drunkard who has always coveted her. While enduring a slave’s existence within this new marriage as well as the community’s derision of her as the “wife with two husbands,” the broken Giovanna is unexpectedly reunited with an embittered Costantino after his exoneration and early release from prison, and the two resume their now‐illicit relationship.</p>
			<p>An exploration of hypocrisy, expiation, and the human disruption of a supernatural order that remorselessly reasserts itself, <i>After the Divorce</i> is set in an insular society of ancient, religious roots grappling with the intrusion of modern, secular social mores and is among the earliest of the serious works on which <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/grazia-deledda">Grazia Deledda’s</a> literary reputation is based. Deledda—the first Italian woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature—critiqued the social norms of her native Sardinia through <i>verismo</i> depictions of the struggles of the lower classes, into which she wove elements of her own personal tragedies.</p>

		<summary type="text">A sheltered young woman’s travels dramatically expand her horizons.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Miss Rachel Vinrace, aged twenty-four and previously interested only in music, is on a voyage both literal and metaphorical. An ocean cruise with her father leaves her for the summer at her Aunt’s villa in an unnamed South American country, where she meets the English inhabitants of the local town’s hotel. As the season progresses she starts to become entangled in their own lives and passions, and through those burgeoning acquaintances and friendships the discovery of her own nature grows.</p>
			<p><i>The Voyage Out</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf">Virginia Woolf’s</a> first novel and was a labour of love, taking her five years to complete. Even though heavy editing was required to reduce some of the more politically charged themes before its publication in 1915, it still bemused some contemporary critics and even garnered accusations of “reckless femininity.” Time however has proved kinder, with the book demonstrating the key points of Woolf’s future style. It even has the first appearance of Clarissa Dalloway, the titular protagonist of Woolf’s later and more famous novel <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf/mrs-dalloway"><i><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dalloway</i></a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young travelling circus owner discovers a clue to ancestral treasure.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>When Dorothy, ropedancer and palmist, arrives at the Château de Roborey with her circus, she’s already observed strange excavations at the grounds. Fate reveals a familial connection and drags her and her motley crew of war orphans into a quest for long-lost ancestral treasure, but her new-found nemesis is always close on her trail.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Maurice Leblanc</a>, most famous for his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> stories, here switches to a new protagonist, but fans of his other work will find her strangely recognisable. Indeed, the mystery presented here is later referenced in <i>The Countess of Cagliostro</i> as a puzzle that Lupin did not have time to solve. This book was originally serialised in <i>Le Journal</i> between January and March 1923, and was published in novel form both in French and in this English translation later in the year. It was also later adapted as a French-language made-for-TV movie in 1983.</p>

		<summary type="text">A chronicle of the lives of three working-class women from the early 20th century.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>Three Lives</i> are the stories of three working-class woman from Bridgepoint—a town loosely based on Baltimore—in the early twentieth century. Each story tells of the hopes, loves, romances and sadnesses of the women as they live their lives.</p>
			<p>Written in a unconventional style, the lives of the three women are uncovered through their layered conversations and interactions more than through detailed depictions. The book is notable for its descriptions of homosexual romance, something that at the time in the <abbr>USA</abbr> wasn’t accepted (indeed, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gertrude-stein">Gertrude Stein</a> moved with her partner to Paris to be able to live openly).</p>
			<p><i>Three Lives</i> was Gertrude Stein’s first published book, and although the sales weren’t as expected it was generally well received by critics. It’s considered today to be among her more accessible books, and is a regular on English literature curricula.</p>

		<summary type="text">In a provincial town a Russian poet draws himself away from society to create his utopia.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Hidden in the forest, the poet Trirodov attempts to secede from the troubled society of early twentieth century Russia to build his own utopia: a school for the quiet children he cares for. Nothing is ever that easy though, and his personal connections to the outside world tie him into the political whirlwind of agitators, factions and power struggles that threaten his solitude.</p>
			<p><i>The Created Legend</i> portrays a stark contrast to the protagonists of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub">Sologub’s</a> earlier work <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub/the-little-demon/john-cournos_richard-aldington"><i>The Little Demon</i></a>, even though the setting is the same town of Skorodozh. There, they varied from at best well-meaning to actively malignant; here the lead characters are idealistic, and isolate themselves from the trials of Russian society in an attempt to maintain their idealism. Trirodov sees beauty and mystery everywhere he looks, and (following the title) works to create his own legend.</p>
			<p>This volume, originally titled “Drops of Blood,” is the first of the “Created Legend” trilogy and the only one translated contemporaneously into English. It was received with some bewilderment by critics: the combination of current affairs and magical events proved too strange for many. However, treated as an early example of magic realism and with the benefit of hindsight, the setting and symbolism is less shocking and more readily accessible to the modern reader.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of science fiction and fantasy stories by Ray Bradbury ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ray-bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> is a giant of science fiction and fantasy. His childlike imagination, yearning for Mars, and love of all that is scary, horrible, and mysterious, reverberate throughout modern speculative fiction and our culture as a whole.</p>
			<p>He has received countless awards including the Sir Arthur Clark Award, the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, an Emmy Award, and a National Medal of Arts. Along with terrestrial honorary street names, there are many extraterrestrial locations named in Bradbury’s honor such as Bradbury Landing, the landing site of the Mars <i>Curiosity</i> rover.</p>
			<p>Some of his first published stories appear in <i>Futuria Fantasia</i>, a fanzine he created when he was 18 years old. All of his stories published in <i>Futuria Fantasia</i> are included in this collection. This collection also includes stories written well into his career, like “Zero Hour,” a story that was later republished in his famous collection <i>The Illustrated Man</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Wodehouse’s golf stories featuring the Oldest Member.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse’s</a> short stories are often set in the salons and townhouses of England, but he also wrote about golf, returning again and again to one of his favorite sports.</p>
			<p>Set against a background of the unique and often quirky world of golf in the early 1920s, Wodehouse produced a great collection of stories chronicling the loves and lives of golf fanatics. Starting around 1919 he wrote these golf stories regularly for both American and English magazines, and published two collections: <i>The Clicking of Cuthbert</i> (1922) and <i>The Heart of a Goof</i> (1926). He continued to write golf stories until the mid 1960s.</p>
			<p>Most of these stories are narrated by The Oldest Member, a talkative type who frames most of the stories by trapping other members of the club into listening to his “words of wisdom.”</p>
			<p>The stories in this collection are ordered by the date they first appeared in magazine form, and are mostly from the English editions—the main difference from the U.S. editions being the names and locations of the golf clubs.</p>

		<summary type="text">A magic-induced tempest shipwrecks the king of Naples and his crew on an island inhabited by the usurped duke of Milan.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Tempest</i>, thought to be one of the last plays that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> wrote alone, begins with a storm which shipwrecks the king of Naples and his crew. We quickly learn that the tempest was not a natural occurence; it was created by Prospero, the usurped duke of Milan who is stranded on a nearby island, with the help of Ariel, a spirit in his service. The rest of the play explores the relationships between the shipwrecked crew, Prospero, his daughter Miranda, and a native of the island: a half human, half monster called Caliban.</p>
			<p>Though this play is traditionally classified as a comedy, more modern scholarship, out of a desire to highlight the dramatic elements of some of Shakespeare’s comedies, created a genre subgroup called the “late romances.” <i>The Tempest</i> is included in that subgroup.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">An aging king divides his kingdom between his two eldest daughters, slighting the third, and comes to bitterly regret his decision.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>King Lear</i> is a tragedy by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, written about 1605 or 1606. Shakespeare based it on the legendary King Leir of the Britons, whose story is outlined in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s pseudohistorical <i>History of the Kings of Britain</i> (written in about 1136).</p>
			<p>The play tells the tale of the aged King Lear who is passing on the control of his kingdom to his three daughters. He asks each of them to express their love for him, and the first two, Goneril and Regan do so effusively, saying they love him above all things. But his youngest daughter, Cordelia, is compelled to be truthful and says that she must reserve some love for her future husband. Lear, enraged, cuts her off without any inheritance.</p>
			<p>The secondary plot deals with the machinations of Edmund, the bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester, who manages to convince his father that his legitimate son Edgar is plotting against him.</p>
			<p>After Lear steps down from power, he finds that his elder daughters have no real respect or love for him, and treat him and his followers as a nuisance. They allow the raging Lear to wander out into a storm, hoping to be rid of him, and conspire with Edmund to overthrow the Earl of Gloucester.</p>
			<p>The play is a moving study of the perils of old age and the true meaning of filial love. It ends tragically with the deaths of both Cordelia and Lear—so tragically, in fact, that performances during the Restoration period sometimes substituted a happy ending. In modern times, though, <i>King Lear</i> is performed as written and generally regarded as one of Shakespeare’s best plays.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">When Lord Dawlish unexpectedly comes into an inheritance, he travels from London to New York to try to give it away.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Affable and honourable, Lord Dawlish is the second poorest peer in England, relying on his income as a club secretary. Claire Fenwick, his beautiful fiancée, will not marry him until he has some money, so he draws up plans to travel to New York and make his fortune. When he unexpectedly comes into an inheritance, he attempts to give it to the person he believes is the more deserving recipient. This, however, proves more difficult than expected.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse">Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse</a> was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the twentieth century. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early writing mostly consisted of school stories, but he later switched to writing comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years, such as Bertie Wooster and Jeeves.</p>

		<summary type="text">Four witty and biting biographies of Victorians that take aim at the moral superiority of their subject’s time.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Eminent Victorians</i> consists of four short biographies by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lytton-strachey">Lytton Strachey</a> of Victorians who were famous in their day: Cardinal Manning, a powerful cleric; Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing; Thomas Arnold, creator of the modern-day English public school; and General Gordon, a popular officer of the British Army.</p>
			<p>In Strachey’s day, these people were considered heroes and paragons of Victorian morality and ethics. But instead of lengthy, glowing biographies, Strachey opts for short, witty, and biting biographies that skewer their subjects. All of them are portrayed with their human flaws and moral contradictions on full display, implicitly knocking down the sanctimonious visions of these former heroes (perhaps with the exception of Nightingale, who, while portrayed as an often-cold and mercilessly-driven taskmistress, nevertheless escaped with her reputation enhanced, not tarnished).</p>
			<p>The biographies are not only interesting for their wit, humor, and readability, but because of the windows they open to the issues of the age. Manning’s biography occurs against the backdrop of a time of upheaval in the English Catholic church, with concepts like Papal Infallability entering the picture; Nightingale’s biography shines light on the appalling conditions of war; Arnold’s biography is a lens on the development of formal education and schools; and Gordon’s biography reveals England as an empire teetering unsteadily, whose ability to influence and control faraway lands is not as certain as it might think.</p>
			<p><i>Eminent Victorians</i> took six years to write and was met with glowing reviews on its publication. It made Strachey famous and cemented his name in the list of literature’s top-tier biographers.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adventure tale of smuggling, treasure and shipwreck.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Moonfleet is a small village near the sea in the south of England, where village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John “Blackbeard” Mohune who is buried in a family crypt under the church. He is said to have stolen and hidden a diamond from King Charles I. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for the diamond, and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities.</p>
			<p>One night a bad storm floods the village. While attending the Sunday service at church, John Trenchard—an orphan who lives with his aunt—hears strange sounds from the crypt below. Investigating, he soon finds himself in a smuggler’s hideout, where he discovers a locket in a coffin that holds a piece of paper inscribed with Bible verses.</p>
			<p>John soon finds himself swept up in a smuggling venture planned by Elzevir Block, the smugglers’ leader, and inadvertently finds out that the verses from Blackbeard’s locket contain a code that will reveal the location of the famous diamond.</p>
			<p><i>Moonfleet</i> was hugely popular in its day and was even sometimes studied in schools. Adaptations to screen, radio, and theater continue today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Xavier de Maistre’s short fiction, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/xavier-de-maistre">Xavier de Maistre</a> lived mostly as a military man, fighting in France and Russia around the turn of the 19th century. In 1790 a duel he participated in led him to be put under arrest in Turin; during his confinement in a tiny chamber, he wrote his most famous work, “A Journey Round My Room.”</p>
			<p>“Journey” is a short story written as a parody of the grand travelogues popular at the time. He frames his six weeks’ confinement as a long journey across the unknown land of his room, visiting the furniture, the paintings on the wall, and even venturing to the north side. De Maistre didn’t hold the work in very high regard, but after his brother had it published in 1794 it became a fast success, eventually calling for a sequel (“A Night Journey Round My Room”), and warranting allusions in fiction by writers like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham">W. Somerset Maugham</a>, and Jorge Luis Borges.</p>
			<p>The rest of his literary corpus is modest, and consists entirely of short works. “The Leper of the City of Aosta” is a philosophical dialogue on the struggles of a leper whose days are seemingly filled with unending sorrow; “The Prisoners of the Caucasus” is the fictional narrative of a captured general and his faithful servant, set against a rich background of Cossack factions in the Caucasus of Imperial Russia reminiscent of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/hadji-murad/aylmer-maude">Hadji Murád</a></i>; and “The Young Siberian” is the true story of Prascovia Lopouloff, a poor Russian girl who sets out on a journey to secure an imperial pardon for her exiled father.</p>
			<p>De Maistre never set out to have a literary career, but his carefully-considered output made him famous across the continent.</p>

		<summary type="text">An anthology of William Carlos Williams’ poetry collections, combining The Tempers (1913), Al Que Quiere! (1917), and Sour Grapes (1921).</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Poems</i> is an anthology of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-carlos-williams">William Carlos Williams’</a> poetry collections, combining <i>The Tempers</i> (1913), <i>Al Que Quiere!</i> (1917), and <i>Sour Grapes</i> (1921). Williams is recognized as one of the foremost poets of American Modernism. In these collections a reader may perceive Williams’ contact with and subsequent growth through and away from Imagism. The poet’s work asserts a decidedly American approach to Modernism and features highly localized diction and imagery.</p>
			<p>William Carlos Williams was born in 1883, grew up in New Jersey, and was educated in Europe and the United States. He was friends with Hilda Doolittle “<abbr>H. D.</abbr>” and Ezra Pound, and through these friendships was introduced to Imagism. He eventually broke with the Imagists and invested himself instead in capturing the unique diction and linguistic intermingling of the United States, while remaining committed to the concreteness that characterizes Imagism. A practising doctor, Williams included many images of bodies, sickness, and medical care in his early poems. Williams later claimed there are “no ideas but in things,” a sentiment rooted in both his contact with Imagism and his firm sense of place.</p>
			<p>Williams continued to read and respond to expatriate and English Modernism, culminating in his long work <i>Paterson</i>. In his later career Williams influenced postwar literary movements, most notably the Beat Generation. He died in 1963.</p>

		<summary type="text">Filled with remorse after abandoning his wife and baby daughter, Michael Henchard, an out-of-work hay-trusser, resolves to set his life on a better path.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Like many of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-hardy">Hardy’s</a> novels, <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i> is set in the fictional county of Wessex in the mid 1800s. It begins with Michael Henchard, a young hay-trusser, drunk on rum, auctioning off his wife and baby daughter at a village fair. The next day, overcome with remorse, Henchard resolves to turn his life around. When we meet Henchard eighteen years later, temperance and hard work have made him wealthy and respectable. However, he cannot escape his past. His secret guilt, his pride, and his impulsive temper all serve to sabotage his good name.</p>
			<p><i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i> was published in 1886, first as a magazine serial and then later that year as a book. It is perhaps most noteworthy for the psychological portrait of Michael Henchard, a tragic character who remains sympathetic while simultaneously being deeply flawed. Typical of other Hardy novels, it also vividly depicts life in the rural countryside at that time.</p>

		<summary type="text">Thomas à Kempis provides instructions for a Christian spiritual life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Imitation of Christ</i> is a Christian devotional book dating to the early 15th century, originally written anonymously but popularly attributed to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-a-kempis">Thomas à Kempis</a>. A popular piece of religious literature since it was first circulated, the <i>Imitation</i> is divided into four books that instruct the reader to forego worldly goods, to follow Christ, and to receive the sacrament of Communion, all in order to attain spiritual peace. Admired by numerous Christian theologians and mystics throughout the course of centuries, it is today considered to be the most-read Christian devotional work besides the Bible, going through over 745 printings before 1650. The <i>Imitation</i> even found an audience in India with the 19th-century Hindu philosopher-monk Ramakrishna, who cherished it along with the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> as one of his favorite books.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sun-tzu"><span lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzu’s</span></a> ancient treatise on the art of war has exerted enormous influence over both Asian and Western soldiers, covering subjects ranging from morale and discipline to the correct use of spies. Despite questions about the historicity of the author, the text has stood the test of time and remains widely read by strategists, politicians, and even business leaders today.</p>
			<p>Though Dr. Lionel Giles was not the first to translate <span lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzu</span> into English, he was the first to do so in a systematic and scholarly manner. His translation was unequaled until the mid-20th century, and remains relevant today due to his copious notes.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/suetonius">Suetonius</a> was a Roman historian born in about 69 <abbr>AD</abbr>, shortly after the death of the emperor Nero. This book, detailing the lives of the twelve Roman emperors who were known as “Caesar”—some by a family connection to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/julius-caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, some just as a title—is considered to be Suetonius’ most important work.</p>
			<p><i>The Lives of the Caesars</i> is a detailed account of the often dramatic lives of these emperors, whose abilities and morals varied enormously; from the capable, stable Augustus, to the insane Caligula. Several of these men died violently either by their own hand or by assassins. Suetonius, though, is careful to give credit where it is due, outlining the better actions and laws of each alongside an account of the crimes and immoralities they also carried out.</p>
			<p>This turbulent period of Roman history has often been depicted in fiction and in media, drawing on the work of Suetonius and other contemporary historians. For example, Robert Graves’ novel <i>I, Claudius</i> (1934), which was made into a highly-controversial television series by the <abbr>BBC</abbr> in 1976.</p>

		<summary type="text">An ambitious young woman chafes against the constraints of small-town America.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Carol Milford grows up in a mid-sized town in Minnesota before moving to Chicago for college. After her education, during which she’s exposed to big-city life and culture, she moves to Minneapolis to work as a librarian. She soon meets Will Kennicott, a small-town doctor, and the two get married and move to Gopher Prairie, Kennicott’s home town.</p>
			<p>Carol, inspired by big-city ideas, soon begins chafing at the seeming quaintness and even backwardness of the townsfolk, and their conservative, self-satisfied way of life. She struggles to try to reform the town in her image, while finding meaning in the seeming cultural desert she’s found herself in and in her increasingly cold marriage.</p>
			<p>Gopher Prairie is a detailed, satirical take on small-town American life, modeled after Sauk Centre, the town in which <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis">Lewis</a> himself grew up. The town is fully realized, with generations of inhabitants interacting in a complex web of village society. Its bitingly satirical portrayal made <i>Main Street</i> highly acclaimed by its contemporaries, though many thought the satirical take was perhaps a bit too dark and hopeless. The book’s celebration and condemnation of small town life make it a candidate for the title of the Great American Novel.</p>
			<p><i>Main Street</i> was awarded the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, but the decision was overturned by the prize’s Board of Trustees and awarded instead to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton">Edith Wharton</a> for <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton/the-age-of-innocence">The Age of Innocence</a></i>. When Lewis went on to win the 1926 Pulitzer for <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis/arrowsmith">Arrowsmith</a></i>, he declined it—with the <i>New York Times</i> reporting that he did so because he was still angry at the Pulitzers for being denied the prize for <i>Main Street</i>.</p>
			<p>Despite the book’s snub at the Pulitzers, Lewis went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930, with <i>Main Street</i> being cited as one of the reasons for his win.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of middle-class Victorians find themselves pitted against an ancient Egyptian evil.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Beetle</i> was published in 1897, the same year as <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker/dracula">Dracula</a></i>—and outsold it six to one that year. Like <i>Dracula</i>, the novel is steeped in the evil mysteries of an ancient horror: in this case, a mysterious ancient Egyptian creature bent on revenge.</p>
			<p>The story is told through the sequential points of view of a group of middle-class Victorians who find themselves enmeshed in the creature’s plot. The creature, in the guise of an Egyptian man, appears in London seeking revenge against a popular member of Parliament. They soon find out that it can shape shift into other things, including women; that it can control minds and use hypnosis; and that it won’t stop at anything to get the revenge it seeks. The heroes are soon caught in a whirlwind of chase scenes, underground laboratories, secret cults, and more as they race to foil the creature.</p>
			<p>While <i>The Beetle</i> didn’t earn the lasting popularity of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker">Stoker’s</a> counterpart, it remains a strange and unique morsel of Victorian sensationalist fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Wodehouse’s school stories about the lives and adventures of schoolboys in the early 1900s.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>School Stories</i> is a collection of humorous short stories by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse"><abbr>P. G.</abbr> Wodehouse</a> that feature the trials, tribulations and adventures of the denizens of the turn-of-the-century English boarding school.</p>
			<p>First published in schoolboy magazines starting in 1901, the stories originally appeared in publications like <i>The Captain</i> and <i>Public School Magazine</i>. Some were also later collected into books. These stories, written more than a decade before he moved on to his more famous characters like Jeeves and Wooster, represent Wodehouse’s first magazine sales and showcase his early career. While some of these stories are definitely of a moment, they’re filled with delightful bits that would be instantly recognizable to students and teachers of any age. Indeed, the stories experienced a bit of a resurgence in the latter part of the 20th century, and remain a worthy part of Wodehouse’s canon.</p>

		<summary type="text">A beautiful magician unsuspectingly casts her charms on quiet Oxford.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/max-beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a> earned his fame as a caricaturist and essayist, and <i>Zuleika Dobson</i> is his only novel. Despite that, <i>Zuleika</i> has earned no small measure of fame, with the Modern Library ranking it 59th in its “100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century.” Beerbohm’s essays were famous for their sharp wit and humor, and <i>Zuleika</i> follows in that tradition—Beerbohm himself called the novel “the work of a leisurely essayist amusing himself with a narrative idea.”</p>
			<p>The novel follows Zuleika Dobson, a rather talentless woman of middling looks who nonetheless holds an almost mystical power of attraction over the men she comes in contact with. When she begins attending Oxford, she catches the eye of not just the Duke of Dorset, but of the entire male class.</p>
			<p><i>Zuleika</i> is both an easy comedy and a biting satire of Edwardian social mores and of the male-dominated Oxford student culture. Beerbohm also seems to forecast with eerie accuracy the cultural obsession with talentless celebrity that came to dominate the turn of the 21st century.</p>

		<summary type="text">An heiress becomes ward to her disreputable uncle with an unsavory past, tainted by the apparent suicide of a man to whom he owed a large gambling debt, and must help clear his name.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Uncle Silas</i> is told from the account of Maud Ruthyn, an heiress living with her reclusive father, Austin Ruthyn. She learns about her uncle, Silas Ruthyn, and his past reputation marred by gambling and the apparent suicide of a man to which Silas owed a large gambling debt that occurred in a locked room in Silas’ residence.</p>
			<p>In order to clear the Ruthyn name of the rumors of Silas’ past, Austin names Silas as Maud’s guardian through Austin’s will upon his death. Also noted in Austin’s will, Silas would inherit the fortune left to Maud should she die while under his ward. Maud befriends her cousin Millicent and quickly adjusts to life under Silas’ care, despite his often frightening demeanor. Although Silas has proclaimed that he’s a newly reformed Christian, Maud becomes increasingly suspicious of her uncle’s motives as life for her becomes increasingly unpleasant.</p>
			<p>The story of Maud Ruthyn and her uncle Silas evolved through multiple iterations, beginning with the short story “A Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess” in 1839, before ultimately becoming the three-volume novel published in 1864. This ebook reproduces a revised, two-volume version released a year later.</p>

		<summary type="text">A man wrestles with his racial identity and must decide whether it is worth the risks to identify with the culture that he loves.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The protagonist of this fictional autobiography wrestles with race in America from the perspective of someone who learns that he is considered black but also that he can pass as white if he wants to. His personal ambitiousness and racial ambivalence makes him a sort of American Hamlet: undone by indecision. Will he be “a credit to his race” by advancing an African-American heritage he loves and appreciates in the face of a hostile culture, or will he retreat into the mediocrity of a safe, white, middle-class family life?</p>
			<p>Along the way, he shares his penetrating observations about race relations in the American north and south, about the “freemasonry” of subterranean black American culture, about the emerging bohemian jazz subculture in New York City, and about traditions of African American religious music and oratory.</p>

		<summary type="text">A middle-aged man travels to France to attempt to convince a younger man to return to America.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A middle-aged man named Lambert Strether is sent to Paris by his wealthy wife-to-be in order to convince her son Chad to return home to America and take over the lucrative family business. This turns out to be much easier said than done, as Strether finds Chad much better adapted to European life than anyone expected.</p>
			<p>James’ characteristically dense prose is matched by a cast of subtly-realized characters who rarely say exactly what they mean. Widely regarded as one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">James’</a> best novels, <i>The Ambassadors</i> explores themes of love, duty, and aging, all told through the eyes of a man who wonders if life hasn’t passed him by.</p>
			<p>This ebook follows the 1909 New York Edition, with one important exception: Since 1950, it has been generally agreed that the New York Edition had incorrectly ordered the first two chapters of Book XI. This text follows the convention of most printings since then, and the chapters have been returned to what is believed to have been James’ intended order.</p>

		<summary type="text">Edward III declares himself the true heir of France, which launches the Hundred Years’ War.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The authorship of <i>Edward III</i> has been up for debate ever since it was first published in 1596. Its publisher, Cuthbert Burby, published it without listing an author, and any records that might have shed light on the author’s name (or names) were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In the 1760s, the acclaimed scholar Edward Capell was one of the first to claim that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> might have been the author.</p>
			<p>Many other academicians support this claim, or at least suggest Shakespeare partially wrote it, as certain archaic or obscure words and phrases found in the canonical Shakespearean plays also appear in this one. Others argue that Shakespeare would never write something so historically inaccurate; suggestions of possible alternative playwrights include Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, Michael Drayton, Thomas Nashe, and George Peele. While the legitimate authorship may never come to light, <i>Edward III</i> has become accepted as part of Shakespeare’s canon of plays.</p>
			<p>After the King of France passes away, a new heir must take the throne; without any brothers or sons in the direct line, the crown falls to his nephew, King Edward of England. French nobles refuse to hand over France to the English, claiming that the right of succession should never have passed through his mother Isabel, and order Edward to acknowledge King John as the rightful successor. These disputed claims to the kingdom of France launch the Hundred Years’ War.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on G. C. Moore Smith’s 1897 edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">Leo Tolstoy outlines his philosophy of aesthetics.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>What Is Art?</i> is an 1897 philosophical treatise by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> that lays out his philosophy of aesthetics. Rejecting notions of aesthetics that center around beauty, Tolstoy instead posits that art is defined by its role in transmitting feelings between human beings. Furthermore, he argues that the quality of art is not assessed by the pleasure it gives, but whether the feelings the art evokes align with the meaning of life revealed by a given society’s religious perception. In line with his spiritual views set out in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener"><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i></a>, Tolstoy argues that the proper purpose of art is to transmit feelings of human unity and “to set up, in place of the existing reign of force, that kingdom of God, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> of love, which we all recognize to be the highest aim of human life.”</p>
			<p>Tolstoy makes a number of unconventional aesthetic judgments in the course of the book, dismissing such works as Wagner’s operas, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/romeo-and-juliet"><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></a>, and his own past works like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/war-and-peace/louise-maude_aylmer-maude"><i>War and Peace</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/anna-karenina/constance-garnett"><i>Anna Karenina</i></a> as “bad art.” In turn, he praises such works as <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Dickens’</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo">Hugo’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo/les-miserables/isabel-f-hapgood"><i>Les Misérables</i></a> as “examples of the highest art, flowing from the love of God and the love of man.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A spy in London is ordered to stage a bombing to foment political and social chaos.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The place is London, and the time is the late 1800s. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Verloc appears to be an unassuming owner of a bric-a-brac store, but he’s actually a spy for an unnamed country. When he’s summoned by his superiors and ordered to plant a bomb to foment unrest in English politics and society, he finds himself stuck in a more-than-uncomfortable situation.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-conrad">Conrad’s</a> novel is set against the background of the Greenwich Observatory bombing, in which an anarchist unsuccessfully tried to detonate a bomb near the building. Terrorist activity was on the rise, and Conrad uses the fear and uncertainty of the time to explore the meanings of duty and of evil, along with the influence politics and political movements have on terrorist violence.</p>
			<p><i>The Secret Agent</i> is widely considered one of Conrad’s finest novels, with modern critics praising its prescient forecast of 20th century politics and society.</p>

		<summary type="text">A steamer captain in the heart of Africa witnesses the final days of a brutal ivory trader.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Originally published serially as a three-part story, <i>Heart of Darkness</i> is a short but thematically complex novel exploring colonialism, humanity, and what constitutes a savage society. Set in the Congo in Central Africa, the tale is told in the frame of the recollections of one Charles Marlow, a captain of an ivory steamer. Marlow’s search for the mysterious and powerful “first-class agent” Kurtz gives way to a nuanced and powerful commentary on the horrors of colonialism, called by some the most analyzed work at university-level instruction.</p>

		<summary type="text">A tragic starfarer seeks revenge in this epic space opera.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Initially serialized in <i>Analog</i> magazine between 1962 and 1963, <i>Space Viking</i> takes place after the events of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-beam-piper"><abbr>H.</abbr> Beam Piper’s</a> earlier serialization, <i>The Cosmic Computer</i>. <i>Space Viking</i> is a classic space opera: what begins as an interstellar tale of revenge turns into a swashbuckling adventure yarn, and finally into a meditation on empire-building and galactic governance with direct allusions to our modern history.</p>
			<p>This richness of content makes <i>Space Viking</i> a unique read. The reader begins by expecting a lighter sci-fi adventure, and early on the plot delivers; but as events transpire, the reader is deftly drawn away from action scenes and into a more nuanced discussion on governance and human nature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A miserly weaver’s isolated life is transformed by the theft of his precious money and the sudden appearance of an abandoned infant, whom he adopts and raises.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In <i>Silas Marner</i>, author <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-eliot">George Eliot</a> (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans) introduces an embittered linen weaver who withdraws from society after a betrayal of trust. He retreats to work his loom or count and re-count his accumulated gold and silver. The abrupt theft of his money sends Marner into despair, which is interrupted just as suddenly by the appearance of an abandoned infant on his hearth. Marner adopts and raises the child, finding a new place among his community.</p>
			<p><i>Silas Marner</i> was well-received at the time of its release for its “fairy tale” charm, and has since gained appreciation for Eliot’s treatment of alienation, religious feeling and community. It has remained popular ever since its publication and has been adapted many times to stage and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">The children of two opposing houses fall in love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Over four hundred years after it was first published, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> remains one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> most famous and most frequently performed plays. During the late 1500s many playwrights loved to base their plays off of Italian stories, and Shakespeare was no different; he was heavily influenced by the Italian tale “The Goodly History of the True and Constant Love of Romeo and Juliett.” Today <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> continues to spread its influence within literature and performing arts. It has been adapted into 24 operas, numerous films, a ballet, and has also been referenced in law. The play has entertained generations with its romance, deception, revenge, sword-fighting, creative verse, comedic relief, and tragic fate.</p>
			<p>The prologue lays before us the fate of our star-crossed lovers: two Italian households have a long, ongoing vendetta against each other, kept under control only by Prince Escalus, the ruler of Verona. Romeo meets with his friends Benvolio and Mercutio after having his heart broken by Rosaline. Encouraged to find love elsewhere, Mercutio sneaks him into one of Capulet’s masked parties, where he encounters Juliet, Capulet’s daughter. This is the beginning of a love affair that is destined to end in tragedy.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young girl leaves her small-town life in 1890s Colorado to become a highly accomplished singer.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Song of the Lark</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather">Willa Cather’s</a> third novel, was written in 1915. It is said to have been inspired by the real-life soprano Olive Fremstad, a celebrated Swedish-American singer who, like the protagonist, was active in New York and Europe during the time period depicted in the novel.</p>
			<p>The work explores how an artist’s early life influences their work. In the novel, Thea Kronborg discovers her talent as a singer, and goes on to achieve great fame and success once she leaves her tiny village of Moonstone. Cather eschewed depicting rural life as being idyllic, instead focusing on the conservative, restricted, patriarchal structures that its inhabitants live by. Her work is thus considered to be one of the earliest so-called “Revolt Novels.” She depicts a time at the end of the 19th century when the American West was expanding rapidly and Americans were gaining sophistication in their understanding of culture and artists, particularly compared to Europe. The title of the novel comes from the name of a 1884 painting by Jules Breton, which is described and considered in the book itself.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man struggles with finding his purpose in life until the breakout of World War I prompts him to volunteer for the Army.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Claude Wheeler is the son of a successful Nebraskan farmer and a very devout mother. He’s sent to a private religious college because his mother feels it’s safer, but he yearns for State college where he might be able expand his knowledge of the real world. Claude doesn’t feel comfortable in any situation, and almost every step he takes is a wrong one. While he’s struggling to find his way in a questionable marriage, the U.S. decides to enter World War I, and Claude enlists. He’s commissioned as a lieutenant, and he and his outfit are deployed to France in the waning months of the war. There Claude finds the purpose he’s been missing his whole life.</p>
			<p><i>One of Ours</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather">Cather’s</a> first novel following the completion of her <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/prairie-trilogy">Prairie Trilogy</a>, which she finished before the U.S. had entered the war. Cather’s cousin Grosvenor had grown up on the farm next to hers, had many of the traits she gave to Claude, and, like her protagonist, went with the Army to France towards the end of the war. After the war was over, she felt compelled to write something different than the novels she had become known for, saying that this one “stood between me and anything else.” Although today it’s not considered her best work, the novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1923.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>An Antarctic Mystery</i> follows Mr. Jeorling, a wealthy American naturalist whose research has led him to the remote Kerguelen Islands, located in the southern Indian Ocean. Jeorling begins his adventure on the <i>Halbrane</i> after being admitted aboard by the reluctant captain Len Guy, who believes the events in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe/the-narrative-of-arthur-gordon-pym-of-nantucket"><i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</i></a> to be true. In that novel, Pym persuades Len Guy’s brother, William Guy, to lead a voyage to the Antarctic. But the expedition ends in failure when William Guy, his crew, and his ship, the <i>Jane</i>, disappear under mysterious circumstances. Captain Len Guy convinces Jeorling to aid in the search for his brother, and the two embark on an expedition south to the Antarctic in search of the previous voyage’s survivors.</p>
			<p>Despite the fact that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne">Jules Verne’s</a> work was published over fifty years after <i>Pym</i>, the events in the novel take place only one year after the disappearance of the <i>Jane</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">An unlikely love story between Marcus Vinicius, a Roman patrician, and Lygia, a young Christian, blooms under the backdrop of Nero’s rule in ancient Rome.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero</i> was first published in Polish as <i>Quo vadis. Powieść z czasów Nerona</i>. Among <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz/">Henryk Sienkiewicz’s</a> inspirations was the painting <i>Nero’s Torches</i> (<i>Pochodnie Nerona</i>) by fellow Pole Henryk Siemiradzki; the painting, which depicts cruel persecution of Christians, serves as the cover art for this ebook edition. Sienkiewicz incorporates extensive historical detail into the plot, and notable historical figures serve as prominent characters, including the apostles Simon Peter and Paul of Tarsus, Gaius Petronius Arbiter, Ofonius Tigellinus, and the infamous Nero himself. Sienkiewicz used the historical basis of the novel as an opportunity to describe in detail the lives of the citizenry under Nero’s cruel and erratic rule.</p>
			<p>Sienkiewicz was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature in part for his authorship of <i>Quo Vadis</i>. The book was exceedingly popular both domestically and internationally: it was translated into more than 50 languages, sold 800,000 copies in the U.S. within a period of eighteenth months, and was the best selling book of 1900 in France.</p>
			<p>The plot of <i>Quo Vadis</i> follows the love story of Marcus Vinicius and Lygia. He is a young, charming, up-and-coming Roman patrician; she is a high-ranking hostage, a former princess of a country conquered by Rome. Vinicius’s immediate infatuation with Lygia is complicated by her devout Christianity, a faith barely tolerated in Rome of the time. As the painting that inspired the novel foreshadows, Rome burns in a great fire, and Christians receive the blame. The subsequent persecution of the Christians in Rome serves as the main obstacle between the two lovers.</p>
			<p>Sienkiewicz portrays a pro-Christian narrative throughout the book, with the apostles Peter and Paul serving as spiritual mentors to both Vinicius and Lygia. The novel’s title translates to “Where are you going, Lord?”, a quote from the apocryphal Christian text the Acts of Peter, which depicts Peter’s death. The text describes how while fleeing Rome, Peter asks a vision of Jesus the titular question, to which Jesus replies that he is returning to Rome to lead the Christians since Peter, their leader, is deserting them. Peter then realizes he must turn back and remain with his people, despite the cost. <i>Quo Vadis</i> depicts this exchange, along with Paul’s fate and the deaths of Nero and Petronius, Vinicius’s wise and worldly uncle and mentor. Sienkiewicz contrasts Petronius’s and Nero’s hedonism with Vinicius’s and Lygia’s journey to a deeper faith in their God, and with Peter and Paul’s faithful martyrdom, to great effect. As such, the novel is not just a love story, but also a thoughtful reflection on how one’s way of living affects how they see death.</p>

		<summary type="text">An unmarriageable shrew receives a marriage proposal.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the Italian city of Padua, a young gentleman named Lucentio comes to study at one of the city’s colleges. As is often the fate of men in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> plays, Lucentio falls in love at first sight. The object of his affection, Bianca, is the beautiful and docile daughter of a rich merchant. Her father, Baptista Minola, has declared that no one can marry Bianca until her older sister Katharina has been married first.</p>
			<p>Katharina is the polar opposite of her sister: vicious, foul-tempered, sharp-tongued, and stubborn. Any man in her vicinity is at risk of receiving her brutal insults and physical attacks. It’s no surprise that no man wants to marry her—or that’s what she believes, until an equally difficult man named Petruchio arrives in Padua.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">On a ranch in southern Utah, Jane Withersteen refuses to marry a local church elder, and together with her ranch hand and a mysterious gunman she must face retaliatory violence, theft, and murder.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In a small Mormon community in southern Utah, Jane Withersteen, a young, unmarried Mormon woman faces growing pressure to marry a local elder of her church. Elder Tull, a polygamist, already has two wives and seeks to marry Jane not just for her beauty, but to take control of the ranch her late father passed on to her.</p>
			<p>Jane’s resistance to marriage only serves to increase the mounting resentment against “Gentiles” (non-Mormons) in the area. Bern Venters, one of Jane Withersteen’s ranch hands and potential suitor, becomes the focus of this resentment and is nearly killed by Elder Tull and his men before a mysterious rider interrupts the procedure. The rider, a man named Lassiter, is a gunslinger known for his exploits in other Mormon settlements further north.</p>
			<p>Lassiter’s intercession on Venters’ behalf sets off a chain reaction of threats, violence, theft, and murder as Jane Withersteen fights to maintain both her ranch and her independence.</p>
			<p>First published in 1912, <i>Riders of the Purple Sage</i> is considered to have played a prominent role in shaping the Western genre. It was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/zane-grey">Zane Grey’s</a> best-selling book and has remained popular ever since.</p>

		<summary type="text">A thousand years in the future, the builder of a spaceship discovers his emotions.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>D-503 is the Builder of the <i>Integral</i>, the United State’s first spaceship. A life of calculations and equations in the United State leaves little room for emotional expression outside of the pink slips that give one private time with another Number. The façade however starts to crack when I-330, a mysterious she-Number with a penchant for the Ancients, enters the picture.</p>
			<p><i>We</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/yevgeny-zamyatin">Yevgeny Zamyatin’s</a> fourth novel, was written in 1920–21, but remained unpublished until its English release in 1924 due to conditions in the Soviet Union at the time (it was eventually published there in 1988). Its dystopian future setting predates Orwell’s <i>1984</i> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aldous-huxley">Huxley’s</a> <i>Brave New World</i>, and it’s now considered a founding member of the genre. It has been translated into English and other languages many times; presented here is the original 1924 translation by Gregory Zilboorg.</p>

		<summary type="text">A notorious womanizer spreads a rumour that he is now a eunuch in order to gain access to other’s wives.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Country Wife</i> was first performed in January 1672 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It traces several plot lines, the principle of which follows notorious rake Harry Horner’s attempt to carry on affairs by spreading a rumor that he was now a eunuch and no longer a threat to any man’s wife. It was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time, having several notorious scenes filled with extended sexual innuendo and women carousing, singing riotous songs, and behaving exactly like their male counterparts.</p>
			<p>With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the eighteen year ban on theater imposed by the Puritans was lifted. Charles II’s time in France had nurtured a fascination with the stage and, with his enthusiastic support, Restoration drama was soon once again a thriving part of the London culture—but it provided a completely different experience from Jacobean theater.</p>
			<p>Christopher Wren’s newly built Theatre Royal provided a modern stage that accommodated innovations in scenic design and created a new relationship between actors and the audience. Another novelty, imported from France, was the presence of women on stage for the first time in British history. Restoration audiences were fascinated and often aghast to see real women perform, matching their male counterparts both in their wit and use of double entendre.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-wycherley">William Wycherley</a> had spent some of the Commonwealth years in France and become interested in French drama. Borrowing extensively from Molière and others, he wrote several plays for this new theater, with his last two comedies, <i>The Country Wife</i> and <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, being the most famous. At the time, <i>The Country Wife</i> was considered the bawdiest and wittiest play yet seen on the English stage. It enjoyed popularity throughout the period but, as mores shifted and became more strict, the play was eventually considered too outrageous to be performed at all and between 1753 and 1924 was generally replaced on the stage by David Garrick’s cleaned-up, bland version.</p>

		<summary type="text">The daughters of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson use their wits to try to escape American slavery.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The first published novel by a black American author combines real-life stories, including his own story of escaping slavery and recollections he heard while helping others escape, with abolitionist agitprop, revealing ephemera from the newspapers of the time, and sympathetic (if somewhat melodramatic) characters. What emerges from this collage is an indictment of slavery and of American hypocrisy about liberty that found an enthusiastic and enraged audience when it was published in 1853.</p>
			<p><i>Clotel</i> has a complex publishing history, with four separate editions published between 1853 and 1867. These editions contain huge differences in characters and plotting, so much so that they might each be considered separate novels in their own right. This edition is based on the first edition of 1853.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wealthy Athenian lord becomes poor and friendless after his “friends” take advantage of his hospitality.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Lord Timon is known by the whole city of Athens as a very generous man. He offers to bail his friend Ventidius out of jail, hires local artists for their talents, and invites his admirers to a feast and offers them gifts. Timon’s closest friend Apemantus tries to warn him that these people are parasites, taking advantage of him. Flavius, Timon’s servant, also tries to warn his master that his finances are in dire straits due to the lavish spending, and that he owes a lot of money. Both worries are dismissed—until creditors that were once considered Timon’s “friends” demand his debts be paid.</p>
			<p>Many scholars consider <i>Timon of Athens</i> an unfinished work: plot developments that go nowhere, random character appearances, and other inconsistencies make it feel incomplete, and it was never performed in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> lifetime. If it had been, the production might have been considered too controversial because of its allusion to King James I and his lavish spending and debts.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">Sir John Falstaff runs astray of the denizens of Windsor by trying to seduce several local wives at once.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>First published in 1602 by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> features the popular figure Sir John Falstaff, who first appeared in <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i> and <i>Part 2</i>. Some speculate that <i>Merry Wives</i> was written at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I, who wanted to see Falstaff in love; and that Shakespeare was forced to rush its creation as a result, and so it remains one of Shakespeare’s lesser-regarded plays.</p>
			<p>The play revolves around two intertwined plots: the adventures of the rogue Falstaff who plans to seduce several local wives, and the story of young Anne Page who is being wooed by prominent citizens while she has her sights set on young Fenton. The wives come together to teach Falstaff a lesson, and in the end love triumphs.</p>
			<p><i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> is believed to have been first performed in 1597 and was subsequently published in quarto in 1602, in a second quarto in 1619, and then in the 1623 <i>First Folio</i>. Despite holding a lesser place in Shakespeare’s canon, it was one of the first Shakespearean plays to be performed in 1660, after the reinstatement of Charles II and theatre once again was permitted to be performed in London.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson’s 1923 Cambridge edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two sets of identical twins are mistaken for their lost siblings.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is one of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> earliest and shortest plays. This comedy utilizes slapstick humor, word play, and mistaken identities to create a series of farcical accidents. Over time, the play’s title has become an idiom used to describe “an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout.”</p>
			<p>In Ephesus, the law forbids entry to any merchants from Syracuse, and if they are discovered within the city, they must pay a thousand marks or be put to death. Aegeon, an old Syracusian merchant, is arrested and Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus, listens to his story of coming to the city. Long ago, Aegeon was on a sea voyage. Traveling with him was his wife, his twin sons, and their twin slaves. The family becomes separated during a tempest; Aegeon, one son, and one slave were rescued together, and the others were never to be seen again. Years later his son Antipholus and his slave Dromio left to search for their long lost siblings; after the boys didn’t return, Aegeon set out to bring his son back home. Moved by this story, the duke allows Aegeon one day to get the money to pay his fine and to find his family.</p>

		<summary type="text">King Edward IV’s brother, Richard of Gloucester, ascends to the English throne through deadly machinations.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After the bloody battle at Tewksbury and the second dethroning of Henry VI, England and its citizens are finally able to enjoy peace under the reign of Edward IV. The remaining Lancastrian leaders are either killed or scattered to the four winds. Within the kingdom, not everyone is happy with their new king—and when Edward falls ill, his power-hungry brother Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, sees his chance and prepares to kill anyone who stands between him and the throne.</p>
			<p>Richard puts into play numerous schemes to eradicate the line of succession and control the court. The first victim is King Edward’s other brother, Clarence. Rumors lead to Clarence’s imprisonment in the Tower of London, and Richard sends two murderers to stab him to death. This causes Edward’s health to worsen, and the title of Protector falls to the remaining brother. Next on Richard’s hit list is Lord Hastings, the loudest voice to object to Richard’s accession, and who is promptly arrested and executed for treason. As Richard orchestrates murder after murder, the deaths start coming back to haunt him.</p>

		<summary type="text">King Richard II’s wasteful spending habits drive his supporters to revolt.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Against the advice of his counselors, Richard II has been taking money from England’s coffers and spending it on fashion and close friends. In order to continue his wasteful spending, he raises taxes on the commoners and leases portions of English land to wealthy noblemen. He also sees an opportunity to seize more land and money after hearing news of John of Gaunt’s failing health.</p>
			<p>King Richard arrives at Windsor Castle to settle a dispute between Henry Bolingbroke, the Duke of Hereford and son of John of Gaunt, and Thomas Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk. Bolingbroke accuses Mowbray of numerous counts of treason: embezzling funds for Richard’s soldiers, conspiring against the king for the past eighteen years, and murdering the Duke of Gloucester. Mowbray denies these charges and claims to have repented for any wrongs he has caused in the past. John of Gaunt tries to convince the two to reconcile, but his attempts fall on deaf ears. Richard determines that a trial by combat will settle the matter.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of William Shakespeare’s poems and sonnets.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Though mostly known for his plays, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> also published poetry during his writing career. From 1592 to 1593, an outbreak of the bubonic plague swept through England, killing almost 20,000 people. In January 1593 city officials ordered the theaters in London to shut their doors, and work for the famous playwright and actor came to a halt. Shakespeare turned to writing poetry to make ends meet during the closures. While the plague hindered his work in theaters, it provided source material for some of his most famous plays.</p>
			<p>He first published “Venus and Adonis” in 1593, followed by “The Rape of Lucrece” in 1594. While both narrative poems contain sexual themes, their views on love versus lust are in stark contrast. After the theaters reopened, Shakespeare continued to write poetry and went on to publish “The Passionate Pilgrim” and “The Phoenix and the Turtle.” The last of his poems were published in his 1609 quarto, containing 154 sonnets and “A Lover’s Complaint.” The sonnets cover an array of themes: different types of romantic love, real beauty versus clichéd beauty, and the responsibilities of being beautiful.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition includes all of his poems and is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Tyrian prince flees after he discovers a terrible secret.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>King Antiochus has issued a challenge to any suitor proposing marriage to his daughter: answer a seemingly-impossible riddle correctly, or die. Pericles, the Prince of Tyre, discovers the answer to the puzzle, but in doing so, he unearths the incestuous relationship between the king and his daughter. Pericles decides not to reveal the truth, and King Antiochus gives him forty days before his execution. When Antiochus hears that the prince has fled back to Tyre, he sends an assassin after him.</p>
			<p>At the advice of his councilor, Helicanus, Pericles plans to travel until Antiochus no longer wants to kill him. On his journeys he encounters a brutal storm that leaves him shipwrecked in Pentapolis.</p>
			<p>This play draws from many sources: <i>Confessio Amantis</i> by John Gower (who appears in the play as the chorus), <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey/william-cullen-bryant">The Odyssey</a></i>, Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>, and Plutarch’s <i>Lives</i>. The themes of separated families and mistaken death refer back to Shakespeare’s earlier plays, like <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/the-comedy-of-errors">The Comedy of Errors</a></i>.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">One couple is tricked into falling in love, and another couple is tricked into falling out of love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> wrote <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> towards the middle of his career, sometime between 1598 and 1599. It was first published in quarto in 1600 and later collected into <i><abbr>Mr.</abbr> William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies</i> in 1623. The earliest recorded performance of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> was performed for the newly-married Princess Elizabeth and Frederick the Fifth, Elector Palatine in 1613.</p>
			<p>Shakespeare’s sources of inspiration for this play can be found in Italian culture and popular texts published in the sixteenth century. Gossip involving lovers deceived into believing each other false was often spread throughout Northern Italy. Works like Ludovico Ariosto’s <i>Orlando Furioso</i> and Edmund Spencer’s <i>Fearie Queene</i> also feature tricked lovers like Claudio and Hero. Besides these similarities, the idea of tricking a couple like Benedick and Beatrice into <em>falling in love</em> was an original and unusual idea at the time.</p>
			<p>The play focuses on two couples: upon the noblemen’s return to Messina, Claudio and Hero quickly fall in love and wish to marry in a week; on the contrary, Benedick and Beatrice resume their verbal war, exchanging insults with each other. To pass the time prior to the marriage a plot to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love has been set in motion. Unbeknownst to both our couples, a fouler plot to crush the love and happiness between Hero and Claudio has also begun to unfold.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Suffolk returns from France bringing the new Queen of England, Margaret of Anjou, and a peace treaty. The Duke of Gloucester discovers that the French forces are allowed to keep the territories of Anjou and Maine in a trade for Margaret; he foresees that England will lose what little control remains over France. Because Gloucester heavily influences King Henry VI’s decisions and is highly respected amongst his peers, he is seen as a major target.</p>
			<p>Cardinal Beaufort, Gloucester’s main rival, mentions to Buckingham and Somerset his interest in removing Gloucester. The Duke of York sees Gloucester’s death as an opportunity to grab the English throne for himself. The French are also in favor of removing Gloucester from power. For Queen Margaret and the Duke of Suffolk to manipulate the king and help France, Henry’s most loyal advisor must not stand in their way.</p>

		<summary type="text">Shakespeare’s 1599 play chronicling the history of King Henry the Fifth and his famous victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> around 1599, <i>The Life of Henry the Fifth</i>, more commonly known as <i>Henry V</i>, chronicles the later history of King Henry the Fifth of England and his efforts during Hundred Years’ War to reclaim disputed territories in France. The play starts with Henry’s claims to be the rightful heir to the French throne and, after his invasion of France, culminates with his famous and improbable victory at the Battle of Agincourt and the negotiation of the Treaty of Troyes.</p>
			<p><i>Henry V</i> is believed to have been first performed in 1599 and first appears in a “bad” quarto in 1600, so-called because it contains a shortened version, likely unauthorized and potentially just based on a performance. This quarto was republished again in 1602 by a different printer and again in 1619. The first definitive text is the version published in the 1623 <i>First Folio</i>.</p>
			<p>The play is the last part of a series of four history plays written by Shakespeare, including <i>Richard II</i>, <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i>, and <i>Henry IV, Part 2</i> and many of characters like Henry (who appears as a wild young Hal in the <i>Henry IV</i>s), Pistol, Bardolph, and Mistress Quickly would have therefore been familiar to the audience. It contains some of Shakespeare’s most memorable lines and is often held up as a powerful portrayal of inspirational leadership.</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

		<summary type="text">The rebel forces plan another assault against King Henry’s forces after losing at the Battle of Shrewsbury.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>As the dust settles on the battlefield at Shrewsbury, news spreads that the rebel forces fighting against King Henry IV have suffered a terrible defeat. Their leader, Harry “Hotspur” Percy, was killed by Prince Hal. The rebel troops quickly abandon the fight after seeing their leader die. Two powerful cohorts, the Earl of Worcester and Douglas, are taken as prisoners by the King’s men. The Earl of Northumberland vows to avenge his son’s death and plans to seek support from the Archbishop of York.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the Archbishop has convened his group of allies—Thomas Mowbray, Lord Hastings, and Lord Bardolph—to plan the next battle against King Henry. If they want a chance of winning, they fight on three separate fronts: one to fight King Henry’s forces, one to fight the Welsh rebels led by Owen Glendower, and one to maintain the fight in France. They decide to follow this plan regardless of whether or not Northumberland lends them his army.</p>
			<p>As the Prince’s merry team of misfits return to London, Falstaff continues to create mischief wherever he goes. After hearing that his father has fallen sick, Hal starts to regret the days when he used to drink and steal with Falstaff. If he is to be the next king, he must leave behind his past along with his partners in crime.</p>

		<summary type="text">King Henry IV faces Welsh and Scottish rebels while English royals plot to betray their own king.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>King Henry IV’s plan to lead a crusade to Jerusalem is put on hold after he hears about skirmishes along England’s Welsh and Scottish borders. The Welsh rebel Glendower has fought off the English forces and has managed to capture Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. Meanwhile, Harry Percy’s fight is successfully keeping the Scottish rebels, led by Douglas, at bay. Meanwhile Harry Perry, better known as Hotspur, has taken numerous political prisoners, including Douglas’s son Mordake.</p>
			<p>The king is also concerned about his son Hal. During this time of political unrest, Hal has been spending most of his time drinking with criminals and highwaymen in taverns on the poor side of London—behavior unbefitting a future king. His closest friend and partner in crime is Sir John Falstaff, a fat old drunk and a charismatic thief. When the king calls for his wild son to return to court, Falstaff and his street-smart group of friends are ready to support their prince on the battlefront.</p>

		<summary type="text">Mark Antony, a Roman triumvir, and Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, become embroiled in a deadly love affair.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> begins two years after <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/julius-caesar">Julius Ceasar</a></i>. Mark Antony was supposed to be in Egypt to conduct government affairs on behalf of the Roman Empire. Instead, he fell in love with the beautiful Queen Cleopatra, became her lover, and abandoned his duties to his wife and country. A messenger arrives bearing news that Antony’s wife and brother are dead after attempting to kill Octavius Caesar, and one of Ceasar’s generals, Pompey, is gathering an army against the Roman leaders. Mark Antony has no choice but to return to Rome. When Antony returns to the capital, he argues with Ceasar over his loyalty to the empire and the other triumvirs. The only way that Antony can prove his fidelity to Caesar is to marry his sister, Octavia. The news of this marriage makes its way back to Egypt and its queen.</p>
			<p>The play was published in 1606 after the great success of <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/macbeth">Macbeth</a></i>. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>

			<p><i>All’s Well That Ends Well</i> was not popular during <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> time, and is still considered to be a play without renown even today. It’s also one of the three “problem plays,” in that it deals with controversial social issues. Although it remains unloved by the public, productions have featured star-studded casts, including actresses like Dame Judi Dench and Claudie Blakley.</p>
			<p>Helena, daughter of a skilled doctor and adopted child of the Countess of Rousillon, is in love with Bertram, the Countess’s son. Helena cures the King of France and is rewarded with a husband of her choice, so she selects Bertram. He contests the legitimacy of their marriage, and insists on demanding that she complete two tasks before he can consider their marriage legitimate: She must wear his family ring, and provide him an heir.</p>

		<summary type="text">This comedy follows four lovers and a thespian who become bewitched by fairies.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> is one of the many comedies written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. It was written around 1595 and first published in Shakespeare’s first quarto in 1600. The exact reason for why this play was produced has been lost to time; some historians theorize that it could have been written for an aristocratic wedding, or for Queen Elizabeth I to celebrate the feast of <abbr>St.</abbr> John.</p>
			<p>The play opens with Theseus, Duke of Athens, and Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, planning the celebration of their marriage. During their visit to Athens four guests—Demetrius, Lysander, Helena, and Hermia—are trying to find their own spouses and to follow each other into the woods. Also entering the woods are six actors practicing a play for the duke and his new wife. Unbeknownst to all, they have also entered the realm of the fairy kingdom, ruled by King Oberon and Queen Titania and inhabited by the mischievous Puck.</p>

		<summary type="text">An adventurer comes to an enchanted castle, where he must rescue a fair maiden from the clutches of an enchantress.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-morris">William Morris</a> is famous in no small part for his contributions to defining the genre of modern fantasy literature, and <i>The Wood Beyond the World</i> is a classic example of that influence. Written in a purposefully-antiquated prose style reminiscent of Sir Thomas Malory or other aged fairy tales, <i>The Wood Beyond the World</i> can be difficult for some readers; but those who follow through will enjoy a charming and influential series of picaresque adventures.</p>
			<p>The book follows Golden Walter, a man leaving home who finds himself swept away to an enchanted land. He encounters a fair maiden who is trapped by an enchantress and her consort. Walter must, like all good heroes, save the maiden and see if they can make it to happily ever after.</p>

		<summary type="text">A beautiful woman escapes a life of servitude under an evil witch to adventure through a series of magical islands.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Water of the Wondrous Isles</i> is a landmark in fantasy fiction. First published a year after <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-morris">Morris’s</a> death in 1897 by Kelmscott Press—Morris’s own printing company—the novel follows Birdalone, a young girl who is stolen as a baby by a witch who takes her to serve in the woods of Evilshaw.</p>
			<p>After she encounters a wood fairy that helps her escape the witch’s clutches, Birdalone embarks on a series of adventures across the titular Wondrous Isles. These isles are used by Morris both as parables for contemporary Britain and as vehicles for investigating his radical socialist beliefs. As Birdalone travels through the isles she slowly evolves into the embodiment of the Victorian “new woman,” embracing hard physical labor, healthy exercise, higher education, socialist values, and financial freedom, while rejecting sexual exploitation, physical abuse of both women and children, and the restrictive sexual mores of the era. This makes her unique in the fantasy fiction of the era as one of the genre’s first examples of a strong female hero.</p>
			<p>This socialist-feminist allegory is presented in an Arthurian-style fantasy world complete with magic, witches, fairies, knights both chivalrous and evil, and castles (indeed, anyone doubting the allegorical nature of the work only needs to look at the name of the tale’s main redoubt: “The Castle of the Quest”). The language is purposefully archaic, reveling in vocabulary drawn from the language’s Anglo roots; and the prose is lent a hypnotic quality by its lack of quotation marks to offset dialog, and its short chapters characterized by a fairy-tale-narrative voice.</p>

		<summary type="text">A 17th-century gentleman is reincarnated on a far-future Earth where the sun has died, and scours the hellish landscape for his lost love.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Night Land</i> is science fiction ahead of its time. Published in 1912, the book introduces a 17th-century gentleman who loses his wife. He soon discovers himself somehow reanimated in Earth’s far future, millions of years from now, when the sun has died and the Earth has become a hellish waste. What remains of humanity lives in titanic mile-high pyramids surrounded by energy shields to protect them from the abhuman monsters lurking in the darkness.</p>
			<p>The human survivors soon receive a distress signal sent by a long-forgotten lesser pyramid, and the narrator embarks on a bloody quest to rescue the maiden of the pyramid—which he knows to be his lost love, somehow transcending time and space. On his journey the narrator is beset by countless horrifying monsters, many of them mutated former-humans. These depictions are so singular that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a> called <i>The Night Land</i> “one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written.”</p>
			<p>The novel is unique in its farsighted depiction of technology. The narrator has telepathic powers and is able to communicate with others over long distances. These powers are enabled by his “brain elements,” which are possibly surgically-implanted. Telepathic communications may be spied upon by the monsters of the waste, but a “master word” sent by the caller may verify the integrity of the signal—a description of a kind of early public-key cryptography.</p>
			<p>The narrator survives on food pellets and “powdered water,” predicting a kind of astronaut food. His weapon of choice is a Diskos, a kind of whirling razor-sharp blade that shoots fire and energy. The machines and force fields of the human pyramid monument are powered by “Earth current,” which the narrator worries is slowly becoming dimmer over the years. The pyramid itself is a jewel of imagination: described as miles wide and miles high, each layer is its own city, and it continues deep underground where artificial grow chambers provide food for millions of humans.</p>
			<p>Though the novel maintains a sort of legendary status for its grim and imaginative depiction of a monstrous future world, critics acknowledge the work as a flawed masterpiece. The narrative is written in a highly affected style, perhaps meant to emulate 17th century speech, or perhaps meant to be a stylized form of speech used by far-future humans. In any case, it resembles no <em>real</em> style of English, past or present. While some critics praise this style as uniquely atmospheric, others point to it, along with the lack of dialog or proper names, as some of the book’s more difficult aspects. Critics also frequently cite the book’s highly repetitious nature, simplistic characterization, and inordinate length—nearly 200,000 words—as major flaws. But despite whatever flaws the novel may have, the awesome vision of <i>The Night Land</i> remains a marvel to behold.</p>

		<summary type="text">The 1879 autobiography of William F. Cody, more commonly known as Buffalo Bill, detailing his early life in the American West.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The popular history of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-f-cody">William Frederick “Buffalo Bill” Cody</a> remains more myth than anything else, yet it’s undeniable that he was a central figure in the American Old West. Pony Express rider, stagecoach driver, trapper, soldier, bison hunter, scout, showman—his résumé reads like the quintessential record of all that makes up the Old West mythology, and it’s all documented in this, his original 1879 autobiography.</p>
			<p>While <i>The Life of Buffalo Bill</i> is rife with the dramatic stylings of the dime novels and stage melodramas so popular at the time, in it Cody presents his version of his life: from his boyhood settling in the newly-opened Kansas territory, to his early life as a frontiersman. It was written when Cody was only thirty-three years old, just after he started his career as a showman and a few years before he created his world famous Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show. Originally titled <i>The Life of Hon. William F. Cody Known as Buffalo Bill the Famous Hunter, Scout, and Guide: An Autobiography</i>, it is an arguably more accurate account of both his life and the American West than the later 1917 autobiography <i>The Great West That Was: “Buffalo Bill’s” Life Story</i> which was ghostwritten by James Montague and published after his death. Although it makes many claims that are disputed today, <i>The Life of Buffalo Bill</i> reveals much about both the historical William F. Cody and the Buffalo Bill of American legend, and gives insight into the history of the American West.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Swedish-American immigrant family builds a farm and community on the Nebraska prairie.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather">Willa Cather’s</a> <i>O Pioneers!</i> was first published in June of 1913 by Houghton Mifflin to high praise. Cather was immensely proud of the work and considered it her first “true” novel, having discovered her own form and subject.</p>
			<p>Told in five parts, <i>O Pioneers!</i> follows the Bergsons, a family of Swedish-American immigrants farming the prairie of Nebraska at the turn of the 20th century. After the death of her father, heroine Alexandra Bergson inherits the family farm, using her insight to transform it from a precarious enterprise to a prosperous one over the following decade. As the Nebraskan farming community grows and her older brothers build families and comfortable lives, Alexandra remains independent, attached only to the land, her youngest brother, Emil, and her neighbor, Marie Shabata. These three central characters navigate duty, familial pressures, tragedy, and uncertain romance.</p>
			<p>With its independent, entrepreneurial female main character, <i>O Pioneers!</i> can be read as a deeply feminist novel that nevertheless upholds American ideals of national destiny through pastoral settlement.</p>

		<summary type="text">Orphaned boy Jim meets Ántonia, the daughter of a Czech family who has immigrated to Nebraska.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Written in the style of a memoir, <i>My Ántonia</i> chronicles Jim Burden’s friendship with the daughter of a Czech immigrant family. Recently orphaned, he moves west to Nebraska to live with his grandparents. Riding the same train is the Shimerda family, who are also on their way to settle in the area. The Shimerdas have a difficult life as pioneers: living in a sod house, working the fields, and running out of food in the winter. Jim soon becomes smitten with Ántonia, the eldest daughter, as they grow up and explore the landscape around them together. Through his eyes, we see both how she shapes the land around her and is shaped by the rigors of poverty.</p>
			<p>Similarly to Jim, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather">Willa Cather</a> spent her early years in Nebraska but most of her adult life in Eastern cities. She pays homage to her homeland with her Prairie Trilogy of novels: <i>O Pioneers!</i>, <i>The Song of the Lark</i>, and <i>My Ántonia</i>. They are tinged with her characteristic straightforward language, reverence for nature, and nostalgia, even as she acknowledges the hardships of the past.</p>
			<p>Published in 1918 to great enthusiasm, <i>My Ántonia</i> is considered one of Cather’s finest works and a defining point in her identity as a writer.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young drawing teacher falls in love with his aristocratic pupil, who falls victim to a devious plot to acquire her considerable fortune.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Woman in White</i> tells the story of Walter Hartright, a young and impoverished drawing teacher who falls in love with his aristocratic pupil, Laura Fairlie. He cannot hope to marry her, however, and she is married off against her will to a baronet, Sir Percival Glyde, who is seeking her fortune. The terms of her marriage settlement prevent Glyde accessing her money while she lives, so together with his deceptively charming and cunning friend, Count Fosco, they hatch an unscrupulous deception to do so nonetheless. In an early 19th Century version of “identity theft,” they contrive to fake Laura’s death and confine her to a mental asylum. Their plot is eventually uncovered and exposed by Hartright with the help of Laura’s resourceful half-sister, Marian Halcombe.</p>
			<p><i>The Woman in White</i> was the most popular of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins’</a> novels in the genre then known as “sensation fiction.” It has never been out of print and is frequently included in lists of the best novels of all time. Published initially in serial form in 1859–60, it achieved an early and remarkable following, probably because of the strength of its characters, in particular the smooth and charming but utterly wicked villain Count Fosco, and the intelligent and steadfast Marian Halcombe opposed to him.</p>

		<summary type="text">A maidservant is forced by her dying mistress to conceal a deep family secret, at great personal cost to herself.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Dead Secret</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins’</a> fourth novel. It first appeared in serial form in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens">Charles Dickens’</a> <i>Household Words</i> magazine during 1856. Like many of Collins’ books, it features incidents and themes which were considered to be sensational at the time; in this case, sex before marriage, illegitimacy, and fraud.</p>
			<p>The novel opens with a scene at Porthgenna Tower, a mansion in Cornwall, where the lady of the house, Mrs. Treverton, is dying. On her deathbed, she tries to force her maidservant, Sarah Leeson, to swear that she will give a letter Mrs. Treverton has written to her husband, Captain Treverton, once she is dead. The letter reveals an important family secret in which Sarah is deeply involved and which she consequently is desperately unwilling to pass on. Mrs. Treverton succeeds in making Sarah swear not to destroy the letter or remove it from the house, but dies before making the young woman swear to give the letter to the Captain. Sarah therefore finds a place to conceal it within the house.</p>
			<p>The rest of the novel deals with Rosamond, the Treverton’s daughter, who grows to adulthood and marries Leonard Franklin, a young man of a well-to-do family, who is afflicted with blindness. Franklin purchases Porthgenna Tower after the Captain’s death, and the couple plan to move into the property and renovate it. Doing so, however, means that they are likely to uncover the hidden letter concealing the family secret.</p>
			<p>While critics don’t consider <i>The Dead Secret</i> to be one of Collins’ best novels, it contains some of the same elements of mystery and suspense as <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white">The Woman in White</a></i> and <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone">The Moonstone</a></i>, and much of his characteristic wry humor.</p>

		<summary type="text">London stockbroker Charles Strickland abandons his family and travels to Paris to become a painter.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Moon and Sixpence</i> tells the story of English stockbroker Charles Strickland, who abandons his wife and child to travel to Paris to become a painter. First published in 1919 in the United Kingdom by Heinemann, the story is inspired by the life of the French artist Paul Gauguin. It’s told in episodic form from a first-person perspective. The narrator, who came to know Strickland through his wife’s literary parties, begins the story as Strickland leaves for Paris. Strickland’s new life becomes a stark contrast to his life in London. While he was once a well-off banker living a comfortable life, he must now sleep in cheap hotels while suffering both illness and hunger.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham">Maugham</a> spent a year in Paris in 1904, which is when he first heard the story of Gauguin, the banker who left his family and profession to pursue his passion for art. He heard the story from others who had known and worked with Gauguin. Ten years later Maugham travelled to Tahiti where he met others who had known Gauguin during the artist’s time there. Inspired by the stories he heard, Maugham wrote <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i>. Although based on the life of Paul Gauguin, the story is a work of fiction.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short vignettes about the people and places W. Somerset Maugham encountered during his travels along the Yangtze River in 1919–20.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>On a Chinese Screen</i> was first published in 1922 by Heinemann Publishers, London. Its 58 short vignettes are based on <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham">Maugham’s</a> travels along the Yangtze River from 1919 to 1920. Although later editions of the book added the subtitle “Sketches of Life in China,” there are actually only a few descriptions of the places he visited and the local Chinese people he met; rather, Maugham focuses on relaying his encounters with a range of Europeans living and working in the country. Maugham is quite critical of many of them and their lack of interest in, and sometimes disdain, for the country and its people, except for the extent to which their careers and pockets could benefit. His sketches highlight the difficulties that many expatriates encounter while living in a foreign culture.</p>

			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/vsevolod-garshin">Vsevolod Garshin’s</a> literary career followed a stint as a infantry soldier and later an officer, and he received both public and critical acclaim in the 1880s.

		<summary type="text">Four young acquaintances in Edwardian London grapple with the quandary of love and marriage.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Although known for her later experiments with style and structure, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> set out in her early novels to master the traditional form. Her second novel, <i>Night and Day</i>, presents itself as a seemingly conventional marriage plot, complete with love triangles, broken engagements, and unrequited affections. Beneath these conventional trappings, however, the book’s deeper concerns are resolutely subversive. The main characters—a quartet of friends and would-be lovers—come together, pull apart, and struggle to reconcile socially-prescribed norms of love and marriage with their own beliefs and ambitions.</p>

		<summary type="text">Veblen outlines his theory of social stratification in an industrialized society, the paradoxical elevation of the leisure class, and conspicuous consumption.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>1899 was the tail end of the Gilded Age, a time in America of rapid economic expansion that caused a select few to become ultra-wealthy, while millions of commoners struggled in abject poverty. It was against this backdrop that <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thorstein-veblen">Veblen</a>, an economist and sociologist at the University of Chicago, wrote <i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i>, a book that brought the phrase “conspicuous consumption” into the modern vocabulary.</p>
			<p>Veblen’s thesis centers on the definition of what he calls the “leisure class,” the upper social class consisting of wealthy individuals who are socially exempt from productive work. Their work instead becomes what he calls “conspicuous consumption”: spending their wealth in increasingly ostentatious ways in order to preserve their class status. Meanwhile, the lower and middle classes are the ones actually engaged in work that is productive to society—manufacturing and industry—with the goal of eventually being able to emulate the social status afforded by the conspicuous consumption of their leisure class masters.</p>
			<p>Along the way, Veblen links these behaviors with social strictures left over from feudal society, arguing that contemporary human society has not evolved far beyond our medieval peasant-and-lord forefathers. In those ancient societies, productive labor came to be viewed as disreputable and dirty; thus, status is won not by accumulating wealth, but by displaying the evidence of wealth. He argues that many of what some would consider society’s ills are linked to this fundamental concept: for example, the mistreatment of women—forcing them into constricting clothing, preventing them from participating in independent economic life—is a way for their husbands to show off their unemployed status as a kind of conspicuous leisure; or society’s obsession with sports, celebrity, and organized religion, all forms of conspicuous leisure that bring no productive benefit to society, and on the contrary waste time and resources, but whose practitioners—superstars and clergy—maintain a high social status.</p>
			<p>Though it was written over a hundred years ago when industrial society was just getting its footing, Veblen’s thesis predicts much of the social stratification we recognize today. Practical labor continues to be viewed as basically demeaning, while people struggle in vain to chase a glimmer of the vast wealth that celebrities, investors, bankers, hedge fund managers, and C-suite dwellers—the conspicuously-consuming leisure class of today—openly flaunt. As such, <i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i> might be one of the most prescient and influential books of economic and social science of the 20th century.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of articles written during the American Revolutionary War that outline Paine’s support for a self-governing America.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The American Crisis</i> is a collection of articles by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-paine">Thomas Paine</a>, originally published from December 1776 to December 1783, that focus on rallying Americans during the worst years of the Revolutionary War. Paine used his deistic beliefs to galvanize the revolutionaries, for example by claiming that the British are trying to assume the powers of God and that God would support the American colonists. These articles were so influential that others began to adopt some of their more stirring phrases, catapulting them into the cultural consciousness; for example, the opening line of the first Crisis, which reads “These are the times that try men’s souls.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A late Middle Ages version of the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-malory">Thomas Malory</a> did not invent the stories of Arthur, King of Britain, but it is fair to say that he reinvented them. Although the legends were already hundreds of years old by the fifteenth century, the contemporary stories of Arthur in Malory’s day were primarily French. The French had added many of the elements familiar to modern readers, among them Lancelot, and the search for the Holy Grail. Malory combined, edited, and added some of his own material to the stories available to him, and in the process created a uniquely British work. (It was his printer Caxton who gave it a French name.) <i>Le Morte d’Arthur</i> is the source material for almost all modern retellings of King Arthur and his knights, from Hollywood movies and musicals to Nobel-prize winning writers.</p>
			<p>Malory’s identity is still in some dispute, as there are several men of various spellings of the name to choose from. Sir Thomas Malory from Newbold Revel in Warwickshire is the most popular choice, but his life of crime—he was a rapist and serial thief at the minimum—seems to be at odds with the acts of chivalry and moral code present in this book. It is known from the author’s own notes that he wrote the book while in prison; perhaps he was trying to make amends for his crimes. Regardless, the result was to give new life to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of prose poems inspired by De Quincey’s opium dreams.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The <i>Suspiria</i> is a collection of prose poems, or what <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-de-quincey">De Quincey</a> called “impassioned prose,” erratically written and published starting in 1854. Each Suspiria is a short essay written in reflection of the opium dreams De Quincey would experience over the course of his lifetime addiction, and they are considered by some critics to be some of the finest examples of prose poetry in all of English literature.</p>
			<p>De Quincey originally planned them as a sequel of sorts to his <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-de-quincey/confessions-of-an-english-opium-eater">Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</a></i>, but the first set was published separately in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> in the spring and summer of that 1854. De Quincey then published a revised version of those first Suspiria, along with several new ones, in his collected works. During his life he kept a master list of titles of the Suspiria he planned on writing, and completed several more before his death; those that survived time and fire were published posthumously in 1891.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Union soldier in the American Civil War longs to prove his courage in battle.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Henry Fleming has joined the Union army because of his romantic ideas of military life, but soon finds himself in the middle of a battle against a regiment of Confederate soldiers. Terrified, Henry deserts his comrades. Upon returning to his regiment, he struggles with his shame as he tries to redeem himself and prove his courage.</p>
			<p><i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/stephen-crane">Stephen Crane’s</a> second book, notable for its realism and the fact that Crane had never personally experienced battle. Crane drew heavy inspiration from <i>Century Magazine</i>, a periodical known for its articles about the American Civil War. However, he criticized the articles for their lack of emotional depth and decided to write a war novel of his own. The manuscript was first serialized in December 1894 by <i>The Philadelphia Press</i> and quickly won Crane international acclaim before he died in June 1900 at the age of 28.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Selma Lagerlöf’s translated short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/selma-lagerlof">Selma Lagerlöf</a> was a Swedish author, who, starting in 1891 with <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/selma-lagerlof/the-story-of-gosta-berling/pauline-bancroft-flach">The Story of Gösta Berling</a></i>, wrote a series of novels and short stories that soon garnered both national and international praise. This led to her winning the 1909 Nobel Prize for Literature “in appreciation of the lofty idealism, vivid imagination, and spiritual perception that characterize her writings,” the first woman to do so. She happily wrote for both adults and children, but the same feeling of romantic infatuation with the spiritual mysteries of life runs through all of her work, often anchored to her childhood home of Värmland in middle Sweden.</p>
			<p>The collection brings together the available public domain translations into English, in chronological order of their original publication. The subjects are many, and include Swedish folk-stories, Biblical legends, and tales of robbers, kings and queens, fishermen, and saints. They were translated by Pauline Bancroft Flach, Jessie Brochner, and Velma Swanston Howard.</p>

			<p><i>The Insidious <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fu-Manchu</i>, first published in the UK as <i>The Mystery of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fu-Manchu</i>, is the first novel to introduce the inimitable Fu-Manchu, famous not just for his moustache, but for being a nigh-unstoppable criminal mastermind and part of the “Yellow Peril.” This novel is a collection of previously-published short stories, slightly re-written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sax-rohmer">Rohmer</a> to form a cohesive whole.</p>
			<p>The narrator, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Petrie, is a sort of Watson to Nayland Smith’s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Holmes</a>; but Smith resembles more of a James Bond than a Sherlock Holmes as the two barrel through action scenes and near-death scenarios planned by Fu-Manchu, a master scientist, chemist, and poisoner.</p>
			<p>This novel was one of the first to popularize the trope of the “mysterious Chinaman,” an element that later became so clichéd that Ronald Knox, the famous detective story writer, declared that “no Chinaman must figure” in good detective stories.</p>
			<p>The casual racism evident in the characters and events is a symptom of the xenophobic climate in the <abbr>UK</abbr> at the time, which was precipitated by many things—the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, Chinese immigration, and other fears. Despite that racism, the plot remains fast-paced and engaging, and is lent a modern air by Fu-Manchu’s role as an early prototype for a Bond supervillain.</p>

		<summary type="text">A series of sketches of a writer’s life in a small fishing village in Maine.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i> was first published in serial form in 1896 in <i>The Atlantic</i>, then later expanded into a novel.</p>
			<p>The narrator, like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sarah-orne-jewett">Jewett</a>, is a middle-aged female writer. She goes to the fictional coastal town of Dunnet Landing in Maine to find time and space to write. There she meets its residents, including her landlady, Mrs. Almira Todd, a widow and herbalist; she rents the empty schoolhouse as a place to write; and she sails with Mrs. Todd to meet Mrs. Todd’s brother and elderly mother. <i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i> is not so much concerned with plot, but with place—its rhythms, its people and its language. It captures the isolation, community and languishing of a small town.</p>
			<p>It is often described as Jewett’s finest work, and one of the most influential works of American literary regionalism. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather">Willa Cather</a> considered it one of the most enduring American literary works of all time.</p>

		<summary type="text">An Abyssinian prince embarks on adventures while exploring the meaning of happiness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Rasselas</i> is a fable-like story, more apologue than novel, written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-johnson">Johnson</a> in 1759 to help pay for the costs of his recently-deceased mother’s funeral. While the plot is basic and the characters are thin, the work is an important philosophical piece exploring whether or not humanity can attain happiness.</p>
			<p>Rasselas, an Abyssinian prince, travels with his sister Nekayah, her handmaiden Pekuah, and the wise poet Imlac—a proxy for Johnson himself. Their exploration of happiness and the meaning of leading a happy life is a complex and subtle one, though the work ends with “nothing concluded.” Johnson leaves the reader to ponder: Can an individual <em>ever</em> attain happiness in any meaningful sense?</p>

			<p>Doctor Syn is a quiet, unassuming vicar in the small fishing village of Dymchurch-under-the-wall.

			<p>As the captain and his crew investigate the tiny town of Dymchurch, the village is struck by a string of mysterious murders, and the king’s men soon find themselves embroiled in a dark conspiracy. The town and its quirky inhabitants may not be all that they seem.</p>

		<summary type="text">Ten short stories of madness, hauntings, romance, and art.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The King in Yellow</i> is a fascinating, almost two-faced work. The first half consists of five legendary weird tales, loosely tied together by a fictional play—the eponymous <i>King in Yellow</i>—that drives those who read it mad. Celebrated by authors like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a> and Lin Carter, these stories are classic tales of madness, despair, and strange happenings.</p>
			<p>With the fifth tale the reader finds a sort of palate-cleansing collection of short prose-poems leading into the last four stories, which take a sharp turn away from the weird and into the romantic. The concluding tales are set in the Parisian art world.</p>
			<p>In modern times <i>The King in Yellow</i> enjoys a reputation largely due to the strength of its first half of macabre tales, but by no means does that make the second half less enjoyable. Both halves are written in a quick, light prose style that demonstrates why <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-w-chambers">Chambers</a> was a best-seller in his day.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of science fiction and fantasy stories by Robert Sheckley ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-sheckley">Robert Sheckley</a> was one of science fiction’s most prolific short story writers. Though less known today than he was in his heyday, he was a giant of his time and was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula awards.</p>
			<p>Even though many of his stories deal with serious topics, they are most widely remembered for their comedic wit. His writing was compared to that of Douglas Adams, who held Sheckley in high regard: “He’s a very, very funny writer. He’s also a stylist. Very few science fiction writers write English well. Robert Sheckley can.” Sheckley was also well-respected by Kingsley Amis who, in his book <i>New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction</i>, included Sheckley in a list with Frederik Pohl and Arthur C. Clarke, and said their volumes should “be reviewed as general fiction, not tucked away, as one writer has put it, in something called ‘Spaceman’s Realm’ between the kiddy section and dog stories.”</p>
			<p>Sheckley wrote about and pioneered many science fiction concepts, such as in his story “Watchbird,” where he explores the ability to detect murder before it happens—three years before <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/philip-k-dick">Philip K. Dick’s</a> “The Minority Report.” Or in “Ask a Foolish Question,” a story about an all-knowing Answerer to whom people pose the ultimate question of life—twenty-six years before Douglas Adams’ <i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i>. Alongside these two stories, this collection includes all of his public domain short fiction ordered by date of first publication.</p>

			<p><i>The Strange Case of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Jekyll and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hyde</i> is the classic novella of split personality. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson">Stevenson</a> wrote it in just a few days while sick and bedridden, and famously burned the first draft after his wife suggested it should be written as an allegory and not as a story.

			<p>The story follows a London lawyer as he investigates the relationship between a brilliant scientist and a misshapen misanthrope. As the link between the two becomes clearer, <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> develops into an allegory on the nature of good and evil.</p>

		<summary type="text">Robert Frost’s Pulitzer-winning book of poetry.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-frost">Robert Frost</a> published <i>New Hampshire</i>, his fourth book of poetry, in 1923. The centerpiece is the long poem “New Hampshire,” an ode to the state. Endnotes on its lines point to shorter poems in the “Notes” section, and the book is capped with “Grace Notes,” a series of short lyrics—some of which are among Frost’s most famous works. The poems are each a meditative brushstroke of Americana, presented in Frost’s trademark plain-spoken but carefully-considered verse. The collection went on to win the 1924 Pulitzer prize for poetry, the first of four Frost would go on to receive.</p>
			<p>Included in this book is “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” “Fire and Ice,” and “Nothing Gold Can Stay.”</p>

		<summary type="text">Autobiographical sketches from the Bengali writer, poet, and artist Rabindranath Tagore.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rabindranath-tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, sometimes referred to as the Bard of Bengal, was a poet, composer, and artist active in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. His poetry had a profound impact on Bengali literature—so much so that in 1913 he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
			<p>Today Tagore is recognized for transforming Bengali art, moving it away from its classical forms by embracing the Bengal Renaissance. Though his artistic output spanned many disciplines, his most famous is perhaps <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rabindranath-tagore/gitanjali">Gitanjali</a></i>, his collection of poems that he himself later translated to English. His impact on Indian and Bengali letters can be exemplified by the fact that two of his compositions were chosen as national anthems—“Jana Gana Mana” for India, and “Amar Shonar Bangla” for Bangladesh—and that the Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.</p>
			<p>In these autobiographical sketches Tagore gives us windows into his childhood, his youth, and his blossoming as a writer and as a lyricist. He stresses that this is not an autobiography, but more like a palimpsest of memories: glimmers and shadows that illustrate his artistic development, not a strict record of his life.</p>

		<summary type="text">Prose poems of offering translated by the author from the original Bengali.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Indian (and more specifically Bengali) literary history, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rabindranath-tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a> was the first Indian—indeed, the first person outside Europe—to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, largely in recognition of his “spiritual offering of songs,” <i>Gitanjali</i>.</p>
			<p>Tagore himself translated the poems from the original Bengali, taking many liberties in the process. His English translation is rightly recognized as a work distinct from the Bengali original, consisting of major revisions, many elisions, and many poems originally published in other collections.</p>
			<p>Tagore’s lyrical simplicity, vivid imagery, and themes of nature, spirituality, death, and transcendence combine to produce a truly unique, powerfully moving work of thoughtful beauty. For many who read it, Tagore’s words in Song XCVI ring true: “What I have seen is unsurpassable. I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus I am blessed.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of science fiction and fantasy stories by R. A. Lafferty ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Though often packed into the genre of science fiction, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/r-a-lafferty">R. A. Lafferty</a> might fit better into a category of the bizarre. Through a blend of folk storytelling, American tall tales, science fiction, and fantasy, all infused with his devout Catholicism, he has created an inimitable, genre-bending, sui generis style.</p>
			<p>Lafferty has received many Hugo and Nebula Award nominations and won the Best Short Story Hugo in 1973.</p>
			<p>Collected here are all of his public domain short stories, all of which were originally published in science fiction pulp magazines in the 1960s.</p>

		<summary type="text">Proudhon outlines the anarchist economic theory of mutualism.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“Property is robbery!” This slogan coined by the French political philosopher <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/pierre-joseph-proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is one of his answers to the titular question of his 1840 treatise, <i>What Is Property?</i> A fervent attack against the established order of capitalism and private property, the publication of <i>What Is Property?</i> almost immediately led to Proudhon’s official prosecution and the revocation of Proudhon’s scholarship by the Academy of Besançon. (Proudhon, an autodidact of humble origins who began his working life as a printer, relied on the scholarship for financial support.) Proudhon evaded the worst of the consequences thanks to the intervention of the economist Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, to whom the second memoir contained in the book is addressed.</p>
			<p>In this treatise, Proudhon contrasts the legitimate right to <em>possession</em>, in which individuals own the products of their labor and the necessary means of production, and the illegitimate right to <em>property</em>, the absolute right granted to proprietors by civil laws to “use and abuse.” Proudhon examines the implications of the right to property and concludes that, among other things, property is “impossible,” “homicide,” and “the mother of tyranny.” As an alternative to both the proprietary and communist systems of economic organization, Proudhon advances his anarchist economic theory of “mutualism,” in which a socialist society would be organized based on free market exchanges wherein the value of a good or service is determined by the time and expense it has cost the laborer to produce.</p>
			<p>This edition of <i>What Is Property?</i> was translated in 1876 by Benjamin Tucker, who was a notable advocate of individualist anarchism in his own right in the United States.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man, given superhuman abilities by his scientist father, tries to find purpose and use for his powers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Gladiator</i>, first published in 1930, tells the story of Hugo Danner, who is given superhuman speed, endurance, strength, and intelligence by his father as an experiment in creating a better human. We follow Hugo throughout his life viewed from his perspective, from childhood, when Hugo first discovers he’s different from others, to adulthood, as Hugo tries to find a positive outlet for his abilities around the time of the first World War.</p>
			<p><i>Gladiator</i> has been made into a 1938 comedy movie, and is thought to be the inspiration for the Superman comic books—though this has not been confirmed.</p>

		<summary type="text">Peter Kropotkin describes the organization of an anarchist society.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Conquest of Bread</i> is a political treatise written by the anarcho-communist philosopher <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/peter-kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>. Written after a split between anarchists and Marxists at the First International (a 19th-century association of left-wing radicals), <i>The Conquest of Bread</i> advocates a path to a communist society distinct from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels">Marx and Engels’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels/the-communist-manifesto/samuel-moore">Communist Manifesto</a></i>, rooted in the principles of mutual aid and voluntary cooperation.</p>
			<p>Since its original publication in 1892, <i>The Conquest of Bread</i> has immensely influenced both anarchist theory and anarchist praxis. As one of the first comprehensive works of anarcho-communist theory published for wide distribution, it both popularized anarchism in general and encouraged a shift in anarchist thought from individualist anarchism to social anarchism. It was also an influential text among the Spanish anarchists in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, and the late anarchist theorist and anthropologist David Graeber cited the book as an inspiration for the Occupy movement of the early 2010s in his 2011 book <i>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">A student at an upscale liberal arts college navigates challenges, pitfalls, disillusionment, and the possibilities of his undergraduate experience in Jazz Age New England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Plastic Age</i> can be read as an exposé on the moral failings of undergraduates in Jazz Age New England, as described through the four-year experience of a young man at the fictional Sanford College. Students enroll at Sanford to “acquire culture,” and do so at an age when they are “plastic” in the sense that they are changeable and meant to be transformed by the experience.</p>
			<p>But, not all of the lessons of a college education are in the curriculum. To a student reader of the 1920s, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/percy-marks">Marks’</a> novel would have looked more like a moral tale, critique, and guide to navigating the challenges, pitfalls, and possibilities of higher education. Marks was an English instructor at Brown University at the time of publication but also had experience teaching at MIT and Dartmouth from which to draw his descriptions of campus life.</p>
			<p>The book was popular, the second best selling novel of 1924. It inspired two motion pictures. But it was also controversial. The novel was banned in Boston and Marks was removed from his teaching position at Brown the next year. College administrators saw the novel’s setting as a thinly-veiled version of their own school and the novel’s portrayal of college life hit too close to home.</p>
			<p>A Sanford English instructor seems to convey the author’s view when he says: “Some day, perhaps, our administrative officers will be true educators; … our faculties will be wise men really fitted to teach; … our students will be really students, eager to learn, honest searchers after beauty and truth.”</p>
			<p>But what Marks sees instead are uninspired teaching and advising, superficial learning, pervasive smoking, prohibition-era drinking, vice, gambling, billiards, institutionalized hazing, excessive conformity, and a campus life that molds its students into less serious people. The author seeks elevation but sees regression.</p>
			<p>Some of the norms and expectations of the 1920s may seem dated to the modern reader, but important themes endure. Marks went on to write 19 additional books and late in his career, returned to teaching literature at the University of Connecticut.</p>

		<summary type="text">The theft of sports trophies from an English public school has unexpected implications on the lives of the school’s students and masters.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this, his first novel, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> offers a glimpse into the insular world of an English public school scandalized by a recent burglary of its prized sports trophies (“pots”) from its cricket pavilion. At first an overzealous master unjustly accuses one of the schoolboys, who happens to be in need of cash to pay a gambling debt owed to his brother. But, thanks to a Scotland Yard inspector brought in especially for the case, the boy is cleared and his promising career among the elite is left intact.</p>
			<p>Along the way, Wodehouse gives snapshots of the everyday lives of various boys: from dealing with the idiosyncrasies of fellow students, to collecting birds’ eggs and sneaking a smoke in the nearby woods while avoiding capture by gamekeepers, to cranking out an underground magazine to raise needed funds. Through it all, the boys, along with their headmaster, handle things with wit and aplomb. Consistent with a worldview in which a man “should be before anything else a sportsman,” sporting contests figure prominently: a boy rises from the canvas to score an unexpected knockout, and another graciously accepts his last-second defeat at the finish line.</p>

		<summary type="text">Stanley Ukridge ensnares the narrator in another one of his schemes: running a chicken farm in the English countryside.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse">Wodehouse</a> once described his writing as “musical comedy without music,” and <i>Love Among the Chickens</i> is one of the earliest examples of his trademark style. The narrator, Jeremy Garnet, is a mild-mannered author attempting to finish his next novel in peace and quiet. Enter Stanley Ukridge, a man brimming with endless schemes, who draws the narrator into his latest, “the idea of a lifetime”—running a chicken farm.</p>
			<p>With little practical knowledge, yet boundless ambition, they move to a country house and put the plan into action. Along the way, Garnet falls headlong in love with a woman on the train, and becomes consumed with winning her heart, despite formidable obstacles.</p>
			<p>The original edition of <i>Love Among the Chickens</i> was published in the <abbr>UK</abbr> in 1906. This newer edition dates from 1921 and is described as “entirely rewritten by the author.” It is the first introduction in print of the character Ukridge, who would appear again in other short stories and novels by Wodehouse.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories featuring Jeeves and Wooster and the upperclass English life of the early 1900s.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Jeeves Stories</i> is a collection of humorous short stories by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse"><abbr>P. G.</abbr> Wodehouse</a> that feature the adventures of his most famous characters, Jeeves and Wooster. Wooster is a wealthy and idle young English gentleman of the interwar era. Jeeves is his extraordinarily competent valet whose name has since become synonymous with perfect service. The stories follow Wooster in his wanderings about London, around England, and across the Atlantic to New York, with Jeeves following in his wake and striving to keep his employer well-groomed and properly presented. Along the way Jeeves must somehow also manage to extricate Wooster and his friends from the various scrapes and follies they get themselves into.</p>
			<p>First published as early as 1915, the stories first appeared on both sides of the Atlantic in publications like <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>The Strand Magazine</i>. They were later collected into books or reworked into novels. Though only less than 50 of Wodehouse’s over 300 short stories feature Jeeves and Wooster, they remain his most enduring characters. They’ve been copied, imitated, and featured in countless interpretations and adaptations. A century later, these stories still are as amusing and entertaining as they were when they were first published.</p>

		<summary type="text">Jimmy Pitt gets much more than he bargained for when he bets his friends at the Strollers’ Club that he can successfully burgle a house.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After inheriting a fortune, and just back to New York from a cruise on which he spotted an intriguing young woman, Jimmy Pitt is drifting. So after seeing a blockbuster play about a gentleman thief, he’s ready to bet his friends at the Strollers’ Club that he could pull off a burglary himself. That night he makes friends with a real-life “Bowery Boy” thief, who helps him break into a corrupt police captain’s house, and everyone gets way more than they bargained for. Later, the action moves to the Earl of Dreever’s castle in England. There, the misunderstandings, threats, cheating, and confusion only multiply, requiring all of Jimmy’s wits and daring to clear up.</p>
			<p>In this short novel, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> takes on many of the themes his fans will recognize from his Jeeves and Wooster books: the ridiculous upper class, the frequent need to hide one’s suspicious origins (while uncovering those of others), and the importance of amateur theatricals, dressing for dinner, champagne, and true love.</p>
			<p>First published in 1910, <i>A Gentleman of Leisure</i> has also appeared in several other versions, under the titles <i>The Gem Collector</i> and <i>The Intrusion of Jimmy</i>. It was also adapted into a Broadway play that starred Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and silent movie versions followed in 1915 and 1923. This Standard Ebook is based on the edition published in 1921 by Herbert Jenkins Ltd.</p>

		<summary type="text">A witty comedy that subverts the harsh social codes of Victorian England.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Lady Windermere, who suspects that her husband is having an affair, decides to leave him. Her erstwhile rival, Mrs. Erlynne, comes to her rescue, and convinces her to return to Lord Windermere before the situation becomes a scandal. In so doing, Mrs. Erlynne exposes <em>herself</em> to scandal, and must choose between her own reputation and saving the Windermeres’ relationship.</p>
			<p><i>Lady Windermere’s Fan</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde’s</a> first hit play, and the first of his enormously popular comedies of society, which culminated with <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde/the-importance-of-being-earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></i>. It opened on February 20, 1892 at the St. James’s Theatre in London, and went on to tour the country for months.</p>

		<summary type="text">Over the course of twenty-four hours, a blackmail plot threatens to bring down a member of the British aristocracy.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Sir and Lady Chiltern are the picture of responsibility: he a member of the House of Commons, she a member of the Women’s Liberal Association. When Mrs. Cheveley arrives in London, she brings with her a letter that threatens to ruin Sir Chiltern forever—his whole life threatens to come crumbling down. The following twenty-four hours are filled with theft, blackmail, farce, and biting social commentary.</p>
			<p><i>An Ideal Husband</i> was first performed in 1893 at the Haymarket Theatre, and it was immediately successful. On April 6th, the same day it transferred to the Criterion Theatre, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> was arrested for gross indecency, and his name was removed from the play. Wilde revised the play for publication in 1899, taking steps to add written stage directions and character descriptions in order to make the work more accessible to the public. Today it’s Wilde’s second most popular play, after <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde/the-importance-of-being-earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></i>.</p>

		<summary type="text">Three volumes of lyrical quatrains about the joys of living, the meaning of existence, and what it means to lead a happy life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/omar-khayyam">Omar Khayyám</a> was a medieval Iranian mathematician, philosopher, scholar, and poet. He was thought to have composed over 1,000 <i>rubáiyát</i>, or quatrains, in his lifetime. Many different scholars have translated selections of Khayyám’s quatrains, but Edward FitzGerald’s translation remains the most beloved.</p>
			<p>FitzGerald’s translation is interesting in that it isn’t a <em>literal</em> translation—rather, FitzGerald took significant artistic license in his interpretation. Thus it’s tough to say if we should call this a translation of the <i>Rubáiyát</i>, or poems by FitzGerald based on or inspired by Khayyám’s quatrains.</p>
			<p>Whatever we call it, this translation is a bright and lyrical celebration of the joys and beauties of everyday life. FitzGerald’s work has remained popular for hundreds of years precisely because of its uplifting and wondrous quality.</p>
			<p>This ebook is based on the fifth edition, which is very similar to the fourth edition, the last edition to be published in FitzGerald’s lifetime. The fifth edition was published posthumously based on FitzGerald’s notes.</p>

		<summary type="text">The Book of Tea is a long essay exploring the relationship between teaism, taoism, and the aesthetics of Japanese culture.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Book of Tea</i>, one of the great English tea classics, is a long essay about the connection between teaism, Taoism, and the aesthetics of Japanese culture. It was written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/okakura-kakuzo">Okakura Kakuzō</a> in English and was published in the United States in 1906.</p>
			<p>The essay targets a Western audience and seeks to explain the importance of tea in Japanese culture, not just as a beverage, but as a form of art expressed in different aspects. After a brief introduction of the Western attitude towards tea, Okakura demystifies the admiration of the Japanese people for this green plant by presenting the different schools of tea, its connection to Zen philosophy, and how it has affected the arts. The famous tea ceremony and its rigid formalities are explained, together with the contributions of the great tea-masters.</p>
			<p><i>The Book of Tea</i> is considered by many to be one of the first books to introduce Eastern culture and philosophy to the Western world. This was possible due to Okakura’s early contact with the English language and Western thought, but also due to his later involvement in the Asian art division of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which he came to head in 1910.</p>

		<summary type="text">Machiavelli’s classic treatise on how to tyrannize one’s subjects.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Prince</i> is a book that was controversial before it had even been sent to the printer. Written in vernacular Italian instead of Latin, dedicated to a member of one of the most powerful Italian families of the day, and only printed after <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/niccolo-machiavelli">Machiavelli’s</a> death, this treatise on how to tyrannize effectively was considered shocking even by his contemporaries. The discussion of its morality that continues to this day gives us the modern-day word <i>Machiavellian</i>.</p>
			<p>The book is organized into several sections, each one giving direction on the ruthless rule of principalities that Machiavelli based on both reading and personal experience. Despite its controversial nature, <i>The Prince</i> is often cited as one of the first examples of modern philosophical thought, and the “advice” contained within is still quoted as relevant today.</p>

		<summary type="text">A group of young Russians veer between nihilism and hedonism as they try to discover their place in life.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Vladimir Sanine has arrived back to the family home where his mother and younger sister live, after several years away. While deciding what to do with his life, he meets up with a circle of friends and acquaintances, old and new, and spends his time as many carefree young adults do: in a whirl of parties, politics, picnics, and philosophical talk. But the freedoms of early twentieth century Russia are still held back by the structures of historical conduct, and their carefree attitudes erode when put in conflict with society’s expectations.</p>
			<p>In <i>Sanine</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mikhail-artsybashev">Artsybashev</a> describes a group of young adults in a time of great uncertainty, with ongoing religious and political upheaval a daily occurrence. A big focus of the critical response when it was published was on the portrayal of sexuality of the youths, something genuinely new and shocking for most readers.</p>
			<p>Artsybashev considered his writing to be influenced by the Russian greats (<a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov">Chekhov</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a>, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>) but also by the individual anarchism of the philosopher Max Stirner. <i>Sanine</i> was originally written in 1903, but publication was delayed until 1907 due to problems with censorship. Even publication didn’t stop Artsybashev’s problems, as by 1908 the novel was banned as “pornographic.” This edition is based on the 1915 translation by Percy Pinkerton.</p>

		<summary type="text">After seeing her name in an unrelated film, a woman traces the clues that lead her to a terrifying secret.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>While watching a film, Véronique d’Hergemont spots her childhood signature mysteriously written on the side of a hut in the background of a scene. Her visit to the location of the film shoot deepens the mystery, but also provides further clues that point her towards long-lost relations and a great secret from ancient history: a secret that will require the services of a particular man to unravel.</p>
			<p><i>The Secret of Sarek</i> was published in the original French in 1919, and in this English translation in 1920. It was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Maurice Leblanc’s</a> first <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> novel written after the Great War, and its impact on Leblanc is palpable: the novel has a much darker tone than earlier works, and even the famous cheery charm of Lupin is diluted. The result is a classic horror story, bringing a new dimension to the series.</p>

		<summary type="text">The famous gentleman-thief plans his most audacious crime yet: to steal the lost treasures of France.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In this first full-length <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> novel the gentleman-thief remains a shadowy figure for most of the novel, working two steps beyond the law with a hidden aim. To fight against this anti-hero, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Leblanc</a> introduces Isidore Beautrelet, the prodigious school-boy detective. Also making an appearance are old foes Detective Ganimard and (in yet another copyright-defeating name change) Holmlock Shears. The battle of wills that ensues pulls Isidore through rural France as he tries to get to the bottom of Lupin’s motives.</p>
			<p><i>The Hollow Needle</i> was originally serialized in the magazine <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1908 to 1909, and was translated into English in 1910. Arsène Lupin starred in many further stories and plays, and a direct sequel to this story, <i lang="fr">Le second visage d’Arsène Lupin</i>, was written by Pierre Boileau and Pierre Ayraud in 1975.</p>

			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a>, with his characteristic wit, plots over the course of nine short stories to steal many of France’s best antiques and artworks from under their owners’ noses.

			<p>This first collection of nine Arsène Lupin stories were originally serialised in the magazine <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1905 and translated into English in 1910.

		<summary type="text">A prince enlists a lady to help him solve eight mysteries.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Trying to escape from her boring life, Hortense Daniel meets the mysterious Prince Rénine (or should we say <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a>?) who enlists her help to solve eight mysteries, starting with one that is for her very close to home. The pair’s travels take them across northern France as they help ease the path of true love, bring thieves and murderers to justice, and eventually to recover something very dear to Hortense’s heart.</p>
			<p><i>The Eight Strokes of the Clock</i> is an Arsène Lupin novel by any other name, with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Maurice Leblanc</a> admitting as much in an opening note. Set in the early days of the character’s history, this collection of mysteries has the hallmarks of classic Lupin: a fervent desire to impress, dazzling jumps of logic and an ambivalent belief that the law can provide justice. This English translation was published in 1922 in the same year it was being serialized in France; it was published in novel form there a year later.</p>

			<p>The gentleman-thief <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> returns in this set of ten short stories to confess—or perhaps boast about—his crimes to the unnamed narrator. Mostly set around Lupin’s attempts to frustrate Chief-Inspector Ganimard and pocket some cash in the process, they also show off his knack for escaping from seemingly impossible situations, and even playing the role of the master detective.</p>
			<p>In the chronology of Arsène Lupin, these tales were published after, but set before, the darker stories of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc/the-hollow-needle/alexander-teixeira-de-mattos"><i>The Hollow Needle</i></a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc/813/alexander-teixeira-de-mattos"><i>813</i></a>. They were serialised in <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1911, and collected into a single publication in 1913.</p>

		<summary type="text">The gentleman-thief recounts the tale of his first major caper.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the process of writing his memoirs, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> takes us back to his early twenties and his first love: Clarice d’Etigues. Although forbidden by her father to meet, that doesn’t stop Ralph d’Andresy—Lupin’s <i lang="fr">nom du jour</i>—from wooing Clarice. But when he finds evidence on the d’Etigues estate of a conspiracy to murder a woman, he cannot help but be drawn into the ensuing three-way race to a legendary treasure.</p>
			<p><i>Memoirs of Arsène Lupin</i> was originally published in France in 1924 under the name <i lang="fr">La Comtesse de Cagliostro</i>; this English translation was published the following year. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Maurice Leblanc</a> was not the only author to call on the myth of Cagliostro as a framing device: both <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe">Goethe</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas">Dumas</a> had written famous novels on the subject. This story showcases a Lupin who is growing into his abilities, and with the swings between outright confidence and self-doubt that would be expected of so comparatively young a protagonist.</p>

			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/arsene-lupin">Arsène Lupin</a> takes on his most fearsome opponent yet in this second collection of his larcenous adventures. More a loving homage than a straight copy, Herlock Sholmes (changed just enough to avoid fallout from a copyright claim by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Conan Doyle</a>) and his companion Wilson are summoned to France initially to throw light on the case of the Blonde Lady.

			<p>This collection of two stories were originally serialised in the magazine <i>Je Sais Tout</i> from 1906 to 1907, and were translated into English in 1910. After an earlier story with an unauthorised <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/maurice-leblanc">Maurice Leblanc</a> was forced to rename his antagonist for these stories.</p>

		<summary type="text">A fictional biography of Joan of Arc from her early teenage years to her martyrdom.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The essential facts regarding Joan of Arc are well known. A young teenage girl hears voices that tell her she will deliver France from England’s oppression during the Hundred Years War. She manages to take her message to the dauphin, who after some persuasion places her at the head of his army. That army promptly lifts the siege of Orléans, throws the English out of the Loire valley, hands them another significant defeat at Patay, and marches all the way to Reims, where the dauphin is crowned King Charles VII. After an ill-advised and short-lived truce, Joan is captured by the Burgundians—French nobility who have aligned themselves with the English—and they try her for heresy and burn her at the stake.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Twain</a> first became fascinated with Joan as a teenager. When he finally decided to write a book about her, he researched it for a dozen years and spent two more years writing it. It was, in his words, “the best of all my books,” and became his last finished novel. Although a work of fiction, Twain’s research was time well spent: the known facts of Joan’s life, and especially the trial, are very accurate in their depiction. To tell Joan’s story, Twain invented a memoirist, Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of her real-life page, Louis de Contes. Twain has the fictional de Conte grow up with Joan, and so he is able to tell her story from her early childhood all the way through the trial and execution. The result is the story of one of the great women in history told by one of history’s great storytellers.</p>

		<summary type="text">The eldest son of Scottish immigrants farming the Iowa prairie struggles to help his soon-to-be wife recover from the violent act that could ruin both of their lives.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The McLaughlins are prominent members of a settlement of Scottish immigrants who emigrated to the still-wild prairies of Iowa. As the story begins, their eldest son, Wully, returns to the family farm after serving in the Union Army during the Civil War. But much has changed in his absence: the girl who once returned his love, Chirstie, now appears cold, fearful, and traumatized, and won’t meet his eye. Wully seeks to discover what happened to her during his absence, and what he can do to set things right, without having Chirstie lose her standing in their tight-knit and very religious Presbyterian community.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/margaret-wilson">Margaret Wilson</a> grew up on a farm in the small town of Traer, and her understanding of the land and its people infuses this, her first novel. <i>The Able McLaughlins</i> won the Harper Novel Prize on publication and then the Pulitzer Prize in 1924.</p>

		<summary type="text">An absurdist comedy that contrasts illusion with reality, in which six characters arrive on a rehearsal stage filled with actors and demand the chance to speak their lines and act out the story of their lives.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i> (<i lang="it">Sei personaggi in cerca d’autore</i>) is an Italian three-act play written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/luigi-pirandello">Luigi Pirandello</a> in 1921, considered as one of the earliest examples of absurdist theatre. It’s a play within a play that deals with perceptions of reality and illusion, and plays with the ideas of identity and relative truths.</p>
			<p>The plot features an acting company who have gathered to rehearse another play by Pirandello, when they’re interrupted by 6 “characters” who arrive in search of their author. They immediately clash with the manager who at first assumes they’re mad. But, as the play progresses, the manager slowly shifts his reality as the characters become more real than the actors.</p>
			<p><i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i> opened in Rome at Valle di Roma and created a huge and clamorous division in the audience, forcing Pirandello to escape out the side door. But a year later it was presented in Milan to great success, before moving on to Broadway in 1922 where it ran for 136 performances.</p>

		<summary type="text">The people of Erl want magic, and get their wish.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The people of the obscure village Erl demand to be ruled by a magic lord, so their ruler sends his son Alveric to Elfland to wed the elfin princess Lirazel. He brings her back to Erl and the couple have a son, but Lirazel has trouble integrating with human society. When a scheme by her father spirits her away and Elfland vanishes, Alveric begins a mad quest to find where Elfland went.</p>
			<p><i>The King of Elfland’s Daughter</i> is written in the pseudo-archaic prose style for which <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lord-dunsany">Dunsany</a> is known. Some contemporaries thought the style did not suit a novel-length work, but contemporary Irish writer George Russell called the book “the most purely beautiful thing Lord Dunsany has written.” The book touches on a range of themes, including the longing for fantastical things lost, the perception of time, sanity and madness, the fear of the unknown, and being careful what you wish for. Large passages are also devoted to hunting; the original edition even featured an illustration of a unicorn hunt opposite the title page. Neil Gaiman wrote an introduction to the 1999 edition, and Christopher Lee was a featured vocalist on a 1977 progressive rock album based on the book.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mysterious god creates a cosmic pantheon to rule over its worlds and time.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Gods of Pegāna</i>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lord-dunsany">Lord Dunsany’s</a> first published book, is a strange and wondrous creation. In it he creates the pantheon of gods who rule over the titular world. The prose alternates between being biblical, high-minded, and childish, with the gods frustrating their human subjects through their single-minded and often completely inscrutable actions. When they’re not busy being mysterious, they’re busy taking revenge on each other.</p>
			<p>It’s possible these short tales were written to convey lessons about life, death, and the nature of belief, though the rhythmic simplicity of the prose and the strange and often petty nature of the gods leaves that up to debate. Regardless, <i>The Gods of Pegāna</i> is a fascinating and influential read.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mysterious gentleman joins a circus troupe as a clown.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A mysterious gentleman arrives at Papa Briquet’s circus, and applies to be a clown; unable to do a backflip, and with the circus unwilling to accept the idea of political discourse among the clowns, they settle together on the role of He Who Gets Slapped. Unfortunately for the troupe, He has motives for joining that aren’t immediately apparent; motives that start to threaten the integrity of the circus.</p>
			<p><i>He Who Gets Slapped</i> was first presented in Moscow in 1915 to enthusiastic audiences, although critics at the time were confused about <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leonid-andreyev">Leonid Andreyev’s</a> subtexts. It is his most famous play, at least partially due to the later release in 1924 of a film adaptation by the newly-formed MGM Studios.</p>

		<summary type="text">Two Russian peasants tragically succumb to selfish, immoral temptations.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Power of Darkness</i> is a five-act drama that follows the downfall of the peasants Anísya and Nikíta as they succumb to a series of sordid temptations, from adultery and drunkenness to outright murder. Written in 1886 but suppressed by censors until 1902, the play is a realist portrayal of some of the darkest elements of Russian peasant life. Similar to some other late <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> works, like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/resurrection/louise-maude"><i>Resurrection</i></a>, the play’s psychological exploration of human depravity is accompanied by a sharp social critique of the Russian Empire and its role in perpetuating poverty and ignorance among its lowest and most marginalized classes.</p>

		<summary type="text">Tolstoy describes true Christianity as a non-hierarchical, nonviolent, non-coercive pursuit, and criticizes institutional Christianity as a deceptive corruption.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i> is the most influential work of Christian anarchism. It might be considered the founding work of that tradition if it didn’t itself claim to merely be pointing out Christian anarchism as the plain meaning of the gospels.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> argues that institutional Christianity with its doctrines, church hierarchies, and ritual practices, is anti-Christian. Christ, he says, explicitly told his followers to reject doctrines, church institutions and hierarchies, and ritual practices, and instead to love truth, to honor God, and to treat all people as your family and as you would want to be treated.</p>
			<p>Tolstoy says that a Christian cannot participate in the political system, which is based on the use of violence to enforce the separation of people and the privileging of some people over others, and at the same time follow Jesus in his command to love your neighbor.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Russian landlord makes reparations to the woman he wronged in his youth.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Resurrection</i>, the last full-length novel written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, was published in 1899 after ten years in the making. A humanitarian cause—the pacifist Doukhobor sect, persecuted by the Russian government, needed funds to emigrate to Canada—prompted Tolstoy to finish the novel and dedicate its ensuing revenues to alleviate their plight. Ultimately, Tolstoy’s actions were credited with helping hundreds of Doukhobors emigrate to Canada.</p>
			<p>The novel centers on the relationship between Nekhlúdoff, a Russian landlord, and Máslova, a prostitute whose life took a turn for the worse after Nekhlúdoff wronged her ten years prior to the novel’s events. After Nekhlúdoff happens to sit in the jury for a trial in which Máslova is accused of poisoning a merchant, Nekhlúdoff begins to understand the harm he has inflicted upon Máslova—and the harm that the Russian state and society inflicts upon the poor and marginalized—as he embarks on a quest to alleviate Máslova’s suffering.</p>
			<p>Nekhlúdoff’s process of spiritual awakening in <i>Resurrection</i> serves as a framing for many of the novel’s religious and political themes, such as the hypocrisy of State Christianity and the injustice of the penal system, which were also the subject of Tolstoy’s nonfiction treatise on Christian anarchism, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener"><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i></a>. The novel also explores the “single tax” economic theory propounded by the American economist <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-george">Henry George</a>, which drives a major subplot in the novel concerning the management of Nekhlúdoff’s estates.</p>

		<summary type="text">A tightly-knit community of opal miners in New South Wales is rocked by the departure of one of their most-beloved young people.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/katharine-susannah-prichard">Katharine Susannah Prichard</a> was born in 1883 to Australian parents then living in Fiji, but she grew up in Tasmania, lived for a while in both Melbourne and London before finally settling in Western Australia. She was one of the co-founders of the Communist Party of Australia in 1921, and her status as a communist and a female writer led to her being frequently under surveillance and harassment by the Australian police and other government authorities.</p>
			<p>She wrote <i>The Black Opal</i> in 1921, and the novel focuses on the very close-knit opal-mining community living and working on Fallen Star Ridge, a fictitious location set in New South Wales, Australia. Life is hard for the miners as their fortunes rise and fall with the amounts and quality of black opal they can uncover. Black opal is a beautiful mineral with fiery gleams of color, much valued for jewelry. Finding productive seams of such opal is a matter of both hard work and good luck.</p>
			<p>The novel is a well-drawn study of the relationships of the people living on the Ridge, and the two main characters are portrayed with clarity: Michael Brady, an older man much respected by the other miners for this knowledge and ethical approach, and Sophie Rouminof, a beautiful teenage girl who is the darling of the camp but who abruptly runs away to America after being disappointed in love.</p>
			<p>Despite the difficulties the individual miners face, there is a community spirit and an agreement on basic values and principles of behavior at the Ridge. But this community of shared endeavor is eventually jeopardized by the influence of outsiders, in particular an American who wishes to buy up the individual mines, operate them under a company structure, and simply pay the miners a salary. This conflict between capitalism and honest manual labour becomes one of the most important themes of the work.</p>

		<summary type="text">A woman’s dawning realisation of her situation leads to a struggle for independence.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Awakening</i> charts Edna Pontellier’s journey of self-discovery. The time spent with a younger friend on a summer holiday on Grand Isle in Lousiana unlocks a feeling in her that she can’t close away again. On returning to her family home in New Orleans, she starts to transition from unthinking housewife and mother into something freer and more confident, although this doesn’t meet with the full approval of the society she’s a part of.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin">Kate Chopin</a> had written a novel previously, but she was mostly known as a writer of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin/short-fiction">Louisiana-set short stories</a>. <i>The Awakening</i>, while keeping the setting, charted new territory with its themes of marital infidelity and less-than-perfect devotion of a mother to her children. The consequent critical reception was less than enthusiastic—hardly surprising given the prevailing moral atmosphere of the time—and her next novel was cancelled. <i>The Awakening</i> was rediscovered in the 1960s and is now regarded as an important early example of American feminist literature.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Kate Chopin’s short stories, ordered by date of writing.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin">Kate Chopin’s</a> most famous work nowadays is the novel <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin/the-awakening"><i>The Awakening</i></a>, but at the turn of the last century she was more famous for her short fiction, published in American magazines like the <i><abbr>St.</abbr> Louis Post-Dispatch</i>, <i>Youth’s Companion</i>, and <i>Vogue</i>. A prolific writer, over the course of fourteen years she penned nearly a hundred stories, although many didn’t see publication until a new collection was released in 1963. The stories focus on life in 1890s Louisiana, a setting that she was living in as a resident of New Orleans and Natchitoches. They’re told from many different points of view, but always with empathy for the struggles, both big and small, of the protagonists.</p>
			<p>This collection contains the forty-nine short stories of Kate Chopin verified to be in the U.S. public domain, including “Désirée’s Baby” and “The Dream of an Hour.” They’re presented in the order they were originally written.</p>

		<summary type="text">Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ classic analysis of modern industrial society and call for Working Class revolution.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Perhaps the most influential and widely read political work of the 19th century, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels">Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’</a> <i>The Manifesto of the Communist Party</i> succinctly lays out the political theory and history of class struggle.</p>
			<p>Following a short introduction, the <i>Manifesto</i> develops over four short chapters, discussing the historical background of class struggle, the relationship of Communists with other socialist and working class movements, a critical review of other contemporary socialist literature and thinking, and finally a brief summary of the Communist position related to the contemporary political situations in various European countries, concluding with the rousing call-to-arms, “Workingmen of all countries unite!”</p>
			<p>This edition, translated by Samuel Moore, includes Engels’ own Preface and footnote annotations written for the English edition of 1888.</p>

		<summary type="text">Julius Caesar’s account of the conflicts between Rome and Gaul in the later years of the Roman republic.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Commentaries on the Gallic War</i> describes the conflicts between Rome and the region of Gaul in western Europe, as well as the Germanic peoples who lived to the east of the river Rhine, and Britain to the north, in the later years of the Roman republic.</p>
			<p>Despite being written in the 3rd person, the commentaries are the memoirs of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/julius-caesar">Julius Caesar</a> himself, and offer a unique insight into these events.</p>
			<p>Before the Gallic war began, the Romans had already conquered the region known as Provincia Nostra (literally: “our province”), which is now Languedoc and Provence in the south of France.</p>
			<p>Julius Caesar had been one of the two consuls elected in the year 59 <abbr>BC</abbr>. The consuls held the highest political office in the Roman republic, but their terms only lasted a year. When his consulship came to an end, Caesar retained power through the position of proconsul, governing Provincia Nostra and two other provinces. This provided Caesar with the necessary command to conduct the military campaigns in Gaul.</p>
			<p>Caesar’s victories in Gaul had huge repercussions on the future of Rome: the related work, <i>Commentaries on the Civil War</i>, documents the ensuing conflict between Caesar and Pompey that ultimately led to the end of the Roman republic and the beginning of the Roman empire.</p>

		<summary type="text">Prompted by a mysterious Icelandic manuscript, a professor and his nephew, with the aid of a local guide, adventure to the center of the earth through the crater of a dormant volcano.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A classic science fiction novel by French writer <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne">Jules Verne</a>, this work is one of the most well-known subterranean fictions to this day. It inspired many similar works and adaptations. First published in 1864 in French as <i lang="fr">Voyage au centre de la Terre</i>, it was quickly translated to English by several different publishers in the 1870s. The current edition was based on the translation by Frederick Amadeus Malleson that was published by Ward Lock &amp; Co <abbr>Ltd.</abbr> in 1877.</p>
			<p>Our protagonist is Axel, whose overcautious and unadventurous spirit contrasts with that of his uncle Professor Otto Lidenbrock, an eccentric professor of geology. When Professor Lidenbrock obtains a mysterious runic-coded note in the manuscript of an Icelandic saga, he is determined to decipher it. Axel inadvertently solves the code and, much to his chagrin, discovers that it is a set of directions left by a sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist to reach the center of the earth via the volcano Snæfelljökull. Reluctantly, Axel joins his uncle on a trip to Iceland, and with the aid of a local guide, Hans, begins an adventure towards the center of the earth, where they will encounter giant mushrooms and insects, an island with an enormous geyser, and battle pre-historic reptiles. One of Verne’s most well-known works, this novel is a testament to Verne’s love of geology, science, and cryptography.</p>

		<summary type="text">Haunted by the part he played in a shipping disaster, young British seaman Jim escapes to an island in the South Seas to build his future.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Lord Jim</i> was first published as a serial in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> between October 1899 and November 1900. The first edition of the complete book was published by William Blackwood and Sons in 1900. The story begins when the young British seaman Jim, one of the crew of the steamer <i>Patna</i>, abandons the ship while it’s in distress. The resulting censure prevents Jim from finding stable employment, until a captain named Marlow suggests he find his future in Patusan, a small village on a remote island in the South Seas. There he’s able to earn the respect of the islanders and is dubbed “Lord Jim.”</p>
			<p>The abandoning of the <i>Patna</i> by its crew is said to have been based on the real-life abandoning of the S.S. <i>Jeddah</i> in 1880. <i>Lord Jim</i> explores issues of colonialism, dreams of heroism, guilt, failure, and redemption. The book is remarkable for its unusual nested narrative structure, in which Captain Marlow and a number of other characters provide multiple perspectives of the protagonist. The gradual build-up of their richly described viewpoints imparts glimpses of Jim’s inner life, yet ultimately leaves him unknowable.</p>

		<summary type="text">An Englishman travels to fictional islands where he meets tiny people, giants, magicians and talking horses.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> was published in 1726 and is probably the most famous work by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jonathan-swift">Jonathan Swift</a>. It was an instant hit—selling out within a week—and has never been out of print, as well as having been adapted many times.</p>
			<p>Lemuel Gulliver, an English surgeon on the <i>Antelope</i>, is shipwrecked and washed up on the island of Lilliput, where the inhabitants are less than six inches tall. This part of the book is a thinly veiled attack on the political classes of the time, as the Lilliputians focus on the minutiae of life, most notably the rift which has developed according to which end of a boiled egg gets opened at breakfast—the big end or the little end.</p>
			<p>On his second recorded journey he is abandoned on an island of giants where he is paraded as a curiosity at local markets and fairs. On his third journey he is marooned by pirates and is rescued by the inhabitants of a floating island devoted to music, mathematics and astronomy. On his final journey he meets the Houyhnhnms, a race of talking horses who have subdued the Yahoos, creatures who resemble humans.</p>
			<p>On his return to England, Gulliver has a very different outlook on life and views the human race in a very different way.</p>

		<summary type="text">John Stuart Mill argues for the social and legal equality of men and women.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Known primarily for his work in political philosophy, ethics, and economics, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill">John Stuart Mill</a> is perhaps less well known as an early feminist thinker.</p>
			<p>Published in 1869, <i>The Subjection of Women</i> was ahead of its time. Motivated by the conviction that the subordination of women was “one of the chief obstacles to human improvement,” Mill argued not merely for women’s suffrage, but for “a principle of perfect equality”—the complete social, political, and legal equality of the sexes.</p>

		<summary type="text">A dramatic imagining in blank verse of the rebellion of Satan against God, Satan’s overthrow, and the Fall of Man.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Paradise Lost</i> is an epic poem written by the Puritan English poet <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-milton">John Milton</a> between 1658 and 1663, and published in 1667. This is a period of English history which encompasses the end of Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.</p>
			<p>Perhaps reflecting some of his country’s turmoil during Milton’s life, <i>Paradise Lost</i> deals with revolution in Heaven by Satan and his followers against God, their defeat and banishment to Hell, and their subsequent plotting of revenge, leading ultimately to Satan beguiling Eve in Paradise to taste the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge against the explicit command of God. Milton’s vivid and poetic description of these events is both dramatic and compelling. The work gained swift acceptance and has always remained a popular and important part of English literature.</p>
			<p>Originally published in ten books, a second edition was published in 1674 arranged into twelve books, the form in which it appears here. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on a 1910 edition edited by <abbr>A. W.</abbr> Verity.</p>

		<summary type="text">An expatriate returning to England after many years in South Africa is accused of a murder he did not commit, and has to flee from the police and other more dangerous pursuers.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1915, <i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> is a thriller set in Britain on the eve of the First World War.</p>
			<p>The novel’s protagonist, Richard Hannay, is an expatriate Scot who has just returned to London after many years in South Africa working in the mining industry. He finds England extremely dull and is just considering returning to South Africa when he is accosted by another inhabitant of the block of flats where he is living.</p>
			<p>This man, Scudder, tells Hannay he knows of a fantastical plot by England’s enemies to create a diplomatic scandal. Hannay, at first skeptical, eventually accepts that there is something in it and harbours Scudder in his own flat. Returning to his flat some days later, Hannay is horrified to find Scudder stabbed to death. Realising that he will be suspected by the police, and that he may also be in danger from the plotters, Hannay flees London.</p>
			<p>What follows is an exciting chase across Scotland, with Hannay frequently coming close to capture.</p>
			<p><i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> was immediately popular, particularly with troops in the trenches of the First World War. It has remained popular and has been used as the basis for several movies including one directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935. It could also be seen as the prototype of several similarly-themed movies and television shows such as <i>The Fugitive</i>.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan">John Buchan</a> continued the adventures of Richard Hannay in a series of sequels. He also had a highly distinguished government and diplomatic career, ultimately becoming Governor General of Canada.</p>

		<summary type="text">An army general chases a network of German spies through Scotland, the Swiss Alps, and the First World War’s Western Front.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1919, <i><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Standfast</i> is a thriller set in the latter half of the First World War, and the third of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan">John Buchan’s</a> books to feature Richard Hannay.</p>
			<p>Richard Hannay is called back from serving in France to take part in a secret mission: searching for a German agent. Hannay disguises himself as a pacifist and travels through England and Scotland to track down the spy at the center of a web of German agents who are leaking information about the war plans. He hopes to infiltrate and feed misinformation back to Germany. His journey takes him from Glasgow to Skye, onwards into the Swiss Alps, and on to the Western Front.</p>
			<p>During the course of his work he’s again reunited with Peter Pienaar and John Blenkiron, who both appear in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan/greenmantle"><i>Greenmantle</i></a>, as well as Sir Walter Bullivant, his Foreign Office contact from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan/the-thirty-nine-steps"><i>The Thirty Nine Steps</i></a>.</p>
			<p>The title of the novel comes from a character in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-bunyan">John Bunyan’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-bunyan/the-pilgrims-progress"><i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i></a> to which there are many references in the book, not least of all as a codebook which Hannay uses to decipher messages from his allies.</p>
			<p>The book finishes with a captivating description of some of the final battles of the First World War between Britain and Germany in Eastern France.</p>

		<summary type="text">An experimental and highly lyrical novel exploring the African-American experience.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Published in 1923, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jean-toomer">Jean Toomer’s</a> <i>Cane</i> was widely heralded as one of the first masterpieces of the Harlem Renaissance, and its author as “a bright morning star” of the movement. Toomer himself, however, was reluctant to embrace an explicitly racialized identity, preferring to define himself as simply an American writer.</p>
			<p>Inspired in part by Sherwood Anderson’s short story cycle <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, Toomer conceived <i>Cane</i> as a mosaic of intricately connected vignettes, poems, stories, songs, and even play-like dialogues. Drawing on both modernist poetry and African-American spirituals, Toomer imbues each form with a lyrical and often experimental sensibility.</p>
			<p>The work is structured in three distinct but unnamed parts. The first is set in rural Georgia and focuses on the lives of women and the men who desire them. The second part moves to the urban enclaves of the North in the years following the Great Migration. The third and final part returns to the rural South and explores the interactions between African-Americans from the North and those living in the South.</p>
			<p>Although sales languished in the later years of Toomer’s life, the book was reissued after his death and rediscovered by a new generation of American writers. Alice Walker described <i>Cane</i> as one of the most important books in her own development as a writer: “I love it passionately, could not possibly exist without it.”</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of poems by James Weldon Johnson.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>This collection contains the poems written by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-weldon-johnson">James Weldon Johnson</a> between 1899 and 1922. During this period of Johnson’s life, he worked as a Broadway songwriter with his brother John Rosamund in the early 1900s, served as a United States Consul in Venezuela from 1906 to 1908 and in Nicaragua from 1909 to 1913, and was appointed as the first executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1920. Johnson’s work arose in the milieu of the 1920s “Harlem Renaissance,” a term which Johnson personally refused to use, favoring “the flowering of Negro literature” instead.</p>
			<p>Perhaps among the most notable works anthologized in this collection are the lyrics of “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” a hymn originally written as a poem by Johnson in 1899. Having been dubbed “The Black National Anthem,” the hymn has taken on the significance of a rallying cry for black Americans and is a frequent inclusion in Christian hymnals.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of James Joyce’s poetry, ordered by date of first publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Though <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">James Joyce</a> earned his literary fame mostly through his short stories and novels, he also published several short books of poetry. In fact <i>Chamber Music</i>, a collection of thirty-six short love poems, was his first major independent publication.</p>
			<p>The title of <i>Chamber Music</i> is said to have come from the sound of urine tinkling into a chamber pot—though this was actually a story made up by Joyce after the fact. As he grew older, he came to dislike the title, saying that it was too complacent. Though the story of the title’s genesis suggests the poems are bawdy and raw, in fact they’re each gentle and lyrical love poems, strictly rooted in the romantic tradition. Though the poems didn’t sell well, they met with some critical acclaim from the likes of Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats.</p>
			<p>“Gas from a Burner” is a short broadside published by Joyce in 1912. He composed it as he was preparing to leave his home, Ireland, for the last time, before embarking on a new life of exile on the continent. Its targets are his publishers, who for almost a decade stalled the publication of his short story collection <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce/dubliners">Dubliners</a></i>. They frustrated him to to such an extent that he thought they were actively conspiring against him to prevent his controversial manuscript from ever seeing the light of day. “Gas from a Burner” crystallizes the rage he felt at that pious, hypocritical, and prudish establishment.</p>

			<p><i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> is one of the most famous tales of pioneer American adventure.

		<summary type="text">A shipwrecked sailor travels through a portal to a lost world populated by fantastic creatures and a strange civilization.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder</i> is perhaps <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-de-mille">James De Mille’s</a> most popular book; sadly, De Mille didn’t get to see this novel grow in popularity, as it was first serialized posthumously, in <i>Harper’s Weekly</i>. De Mille had written the novel before the “lost world” genre had become saturated, meaning many of the ideas were fresh and original for the time in which it was written. But, since he didn’t succeed in publishing it during his lifetime, by the time the novel was made public other authors like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-rider-haggard"><abbr>H.</abbr> Rider Haggard</a> had made the ideas and plot clichéd.</p>
			<p>The novel itself tells the tale of a shipwrecked sailor, Adam More, who passes through a mysterious underground passage into a hidden land deep in the Antarctic, kept warm by a hidden volcano. The land is populated by an ancient civilization whose views on life and wealth are the polar opposite of those held in British society of the time—they view death and poverty as the highest religious and social achievements. As More adventures through the strange land, he encounters fantastic dinosaurs, lovelorn princesses, and the classic kind of adventure that foreshadows the pulp novels of the next century.</p>

		<summary type="text">A wild half-wolf survives a harsh existence before finding love and domestication in civilization.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>White Fang</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london">Jack London’s</a> companion novel to <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london/the-call-of-the-wild">The Call of the Wild</a></i>. In <i>The Call of the Wild</i> we follow a dog’s journey from domestication to wilderness, but in <i>White Fang</i> we see the opposite: a wild wolf-dog captured by men and eventually domesticated.</p>
			<p>White Fang’s journey isn’t an easy one; both the wild and civilization have their share of brutal violence. But he eventually seems happy in a home with a loving family. When read side-by-side with <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, <i>White Fang</i> poses an interesting question: is wilderness <em>really</em> an improvement over civilization? Is there one right way to live?</p>

		<summary type="text">Literary critic Humphrey Van Weyden is pressed into service aboard a seal-hunting schooner by its cruel, ruthless, but intelligent captain.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After a ferry accident on San Francisco Bay, literary critic Humphrey Van Weyden is swept out to sea only to be rescued by the seal-hunting schooner <i>Ghost</i>. Wolf Larsen, the captain of the <i>Ghost</i>, is brutal and cynical but also highly intelligent, and he has no intention of returning Van Weyden to shore. Van Weyden is forced to serve on the <i>Ghost</i>, leaving behind his comfortable world ashore and entering into a psychological battle with Larsen on the sea.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london">Jack London</a> wrote <i>The Sea-Wolf</i> in 1904 following the success of his previous novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london/the-call-of-the-wild">The Call of the Wild</a></i>, and it has gone on to become one of his most popular novels. London actually served on a sealing schooner during his early career and that experience lends a gritty realism to his depiction of life at sea. The book can be read as a psychological thriller and adventure novel, but can also be read as a criticism of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche">Nietzsche’s</a> Übermensch philosophy with Wolf Larsen embodying a “superman” lacking conventional morality.</p>

		<summary type="text">In the far future, a long-lost manuscript describes how the United States descended into a tyranny ruled by oligarchic plutocrats.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Iron Heel</i> is some of the earliest dystopian fiction of the 20th century. The novel is framed as a presentation of the long-lost “Everhard Manuscript,” a document written by the socialist revolutionary Avis Everhard around 1932. The manuscript is discovered in the year 2600, and is introduced and annotated by a far-future commentator.</p>
			<p>In it, Avis tells of how the United States was slowly overcome by a group of oligarchs, the Iron Heel, who use their monopoly power to systematically bankrupt American small businesses and farmers in order to cement their control over the capitalist system. Eventually, the U.S. Army is brought under the control of the oligarchs, who entrench a brutal system of repression against the working class. Everhard, her husband, and a scrappy group of socialists fight valiantly against the Iron Heel, though we learn in the foreword that they don’t survive the fight, and die as martyrs.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jack-london">London</a> uses the narrative as a vehicle for espousing his socialist views, sometimes to the detriment of the plot, and even going so far as to plagiarize an essay by Frank Harris nearly verbatim—issues which caused the work to earn scant critical praise. Despite this, it sold over 50,000 copies in hardcover and influenced a generation of activists, including George Orwell, Harry Bridges, and Frederic Tuten.</p>

		<summary type="text">Goethe’s first major work, a novel of unrequited love, longing, and deterioration into sorrow.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 leveled the city of Lisbon and surrounding areas, and killed perhaps as many as 100,000 people. It came at a decisive time in the history of western thought: the melding of Faith, Philosophy, and Science into a post-enlightenment rational view of the universe. In some sense mankind had just begun to believe he had the universe figured out when the universe struck back with a tragedy so terrible in scale it could not be fit into any box of understanding. It was not predicted. It could not have been prevented. It was not rational. And it certainly could not have been the will of a benevolent God.</p>
			<p>Lisbon was only one moment in a much larger context—industrialization was upending a pre-historic way of life, science was upending nature, and the first great republics in America and France were about to upend previously unchallenged forms of government. It was the awe, inspiration, and uncertainty of all this change that gave rise, ultimately, to Romanticism in art, literature, and music.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe"><abbr>J. W.</abbr> von Goethe</a> is, by some accounts, the father of the romantic period in literature, or at least the proto-romantic <i lang="de">Sturm und Drang</i> (“Storm and Stress”) period. And <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i> was its genesis. It was Goethe’s first major work, an immediate sensation upon publication, and made Goethe a household name.</p>
			<p>While <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltaire">Voltaire</a> parodied rationalism in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltaire/candide/the-modern-library"><i>Candide</i></a>, Goethe transcended it with the semi-autobiographical story of Werther, a young man governed more by his emotions than his reason, whose only employment is his delight in the romantic ideals of the pastoral lives he finds in the rural town of Walheim. There he also finds Charlotte, and in her an idealized but unobtainable old-world domesticity. Werther’s internal dialog about his growing obsession with Charlotte, and his inability to cope rationally with the fact that she is engaged to—and in love with—another man, form the bulk of the book in the form of a series of ever more intense letters to a friend.</p>
			<p>Werther’s descent into sorrow has captivated readers for centuries, helped by Goethe’s intensely beautiful prose (translated here by <abbr>R. D.</abbr> Boylan), enchanting imagery, and obvious reverence for nature and a dying past.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of five of Le Fanu’s short stories, including his most notable work “Carmilla,” presented as cases of the occult detective Dr. Martin Hesselius.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>In a Glass Darkly</i> is a collection of five short stories, presented as posthumous papers of cases of the “metaphysical” doctor <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Martin Hesselius. First appearing in “Green Tea,” originally published in 1869, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hesselius became one of the first literary occult detectives.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-sheridan-le-fanu"><abbr>J.</abbr> Sheridan Le Fanu</a> often made revisions to his work and re-released several under new names, including two from <i>In a Glass Darkly</i>: “The Familiar,” a revised version of “The Watcher,” published in 1851, and “<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Justice Harbottle,” a revised version of “An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street,” published in 1853.</p>
			<p>Most notably, this collection includes what is likely Sheridan Le Fanu’s most famous work, “Carmilla.” A young countess turned vampire, Countess Mircalla uses the anagram of her name, Carmilla, to disguise herself in order to prey on unsuspecting young women. “Carmilla” would heavily influence <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker">Bram Stoker’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bram-stoker/dracula"><i>Dracula</i></a>, which would later become the prototypical vampire archetype.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man in the west coast of Ireland is lionized after he claims to have killed his father.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A young man stumbles into a rural public house in western Ireland claiming to be on the run after having killed his father. He immediately becomes a source of awe and an object of adoration, and even love. But what happens when the inhabitants of this tiny village find out all is not as the stranger claims?</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-m-synge"><abbr>J. M.</abbr> Synge</a> first presented <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin on the 26th of January, 1907. The performance immediately offended Irish nationalists by seemingly insulting the Irish people and language, and the general public, by being an offense against moral order. Before it was even finished, it was disrupted by a riot that soon spread out into the city. When it was performed in 1911 in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr>, the play was again greeted with scorn and the company arrested for an immoral performance.</p>
			<p>But as Synge himself attempts to explain in the preface to his play, rather than attack Irish Gaelic, he wanted to show the relationship between the imagination of the Irish country people and their speech, which is “rich and living,” and that his use of such language reflects reality in a way missing from other modern drama. He later insisted that his plot was not to be taken as social realism, but died in 1909 before the play finally gained broader appeal in the wider world. Since then the significance of <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> has been recognized and celebrated both for its characterizations and its rich use of dialect.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Herman Melville’s short stories, ordered by date of publication.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville">Melville’s</a> pen ranges far and wide in this collection of his short stories and novellas, with subjects including a faraway mountain lodge, a magnificent rooster, a haunted table, and of course the inimitable scrivener Bartleby, whose tale is now viewed as one of the great English short stories. While his earlier novels had been well received, by this point in his career his star had waned, and it was only in the early twentieth century that his work, including these short stories, started to get the recognition it still enjoys today.</p>
			<p>This volume collects Melville’s short stories verified to be in the U.S. public domain, in the order they were originally published in <i>Harper’s New Monthly Magazine</i> and <i>Putnam’s Monthly Magazine</i> (along with “The Piazza” which was written for the collection <i>The Piazza Tales</i>). The racism displayed in “Benito Cereno” against the African slaves is somewhat shocking to modern readers given our greater understanding of their story, but was common in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>

		<summary type="text">A governess moves in to a haunted manor.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>One of the most famous ghost stories in literature, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> earned its place in the annals of influential English novellas not for its qualities as a gothic ghost story, but rather for the many complex and subtle ways the reader can come to opposing conclusions as to tale’s very nature. Are the ghosts the governess sees real, or are they figments of her quiet insanity?</p>
			<p><i>The Turn of the Screw</i> was originally published as a serial, and later went through many revisions by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james">James</a> himself. Though there aren’t any overt suggestion that James intended his novella to be anything but a simple ghost story, the ambiguity in the narrative has captured the imagination of generations of readers and critics.</p>

		<summary type="text">The adventures of an illegitimate young man and his pursuit of romance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>A baby is deposited in the bed of Squire Allworthy, a wealthy widower in Georgian England. The baby is given the name of Tom Jones and given to Allworthy’s live-in sister to raise. She soon marries and has her own son, and the two boys are raised together, with the usual household rivalries and jealousies. As Tom reaches his late teenage years, he discovers the several young ladies that surround, but especially the one that lives next door. Circumstances eventually lead to Tom being thrown out of Allworthy’s house, and the bulk of the novel is about the resulting adventures and pursuit of his beloved Sophia.</p>
			<p><i>Tom Jones</i> is many things: a coming-of-age story, a romance, a picaresque, but it is first and foremost a comedy. It is also one of the earliest English novels, and was hugely popular when it was released, going through four printings in its first year. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-fielding">Fielding</a> used the first chapter of each of its eighteen “books” to weigh in on a wide-range of topics, from critics to religion, and his narrator is as important a character in the novel as Tom himself. Highly regarded and highly popular, it is still in print over three-and-a-half centuries after its initial success.</p>

		<summary type="text">Helen Keller writes about her experiences as a deafblind child learning to communicate.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/helen-keller">Helen Keller</a> was just nineteen months old when, in 1882, she was struck with an illness that rendered her deaf, blind, and unable to communicate beyond basic signs. When she was seven, the arrival of Anne Sullivan, a partially blind teacher, catalysed Helen’s learning and created a completely new way of teaching deafblind children. In <i>The Story of My Life</i>, written when Helen was twenty-three, Helen recounts her childhood and the wonders of a blossoming understanding of the world around her, along with her efforts to become the first deafblind person to earn a <abbr>B.A.</abbr> degree.</p>
			<p>This volume also contains many of her letters, and is substantiated by Anne Sullivan’s own writing and correspondence on Helen’s tuition, along with numerous other accounts. The story was later adapted for both theater and film on multiple occasions as <i>The Miracle Worker</i>, a title bestowed on Anne Sullivan by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain">Mark Twain</a>.</p>

		<summary type="text">Allan Quatermain leads a group of adventurers into an unknown region of Africa in a search for fame and glory.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>King Solomon’s Mines</i> was published in September 1885, becoming an immediate best seller by tapping into people’s excitement for the unknown: in this case, the unexplored regions of Africa.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-rider-haggard">Haggard</a> wrote the novel in a very short period, between six and sixteen months, on a bet with his brother to try to match <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson’s</a> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson/treasure-island"><i>Treasure Island</i></a>. In the process he created a new literary genre known as the “Lost World” genre, which would later influence other writers like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a>.</p>
			<p>The book tells the tale of Allan Quatermain, an adventurer and hunter, who is approached by Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good to help them find Curtis’ lost brother, who went missing while trying to find the fabled King Solomon’s Mines.</p>
			<p>This book has spawned multiple adaptations in the form of movies, comics, and TV shows.</p>

		<summary type="text">Facing the devastation of a nuclear world war, humanity unites under a world government.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>After learning of atomic physics, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells">H. G. Wells</a> began to think of its potential impact on human society. In <i>The World Set Free</i>, atomic energy causes massive unemployment, shaking the already fragile social order. The ambitious powers of the world decide to seize the opportunity to compete for dominance, and a world war breaks out, echoing the looming Great War about to ignite in 1914. Waking to the catastrophe, humanity begins the hard search for a way into a better future. The novel traces a soldier, an ex-king, a despot, and a sage through a profound transformation of human society, and we gain a window into Wells’ own thoughts and hopes along the way.</p>
			<p>With one prophetic stroke, Wells gives the first detailed depiction of atomic energy and its potential destructive power, and predicts the use of the air power in modern warfare. He may have even directly influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist Leó Szilárd, shortly after reading the novel in 1932, then conceived of harnessing the neutron chain reaction critical to the development of the atom bomb.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mysterious inventor travels to a land far off in time.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Time Machine</i> is the novel that gave us the concept of—and even the word for—a “time machine.” While it’s not <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells">Wells’</a> first story involving time travel, it <em>is</em> the one that most fully fleshes out the concept of a device that can send a person backwards and forwards in time with complete precision. Time machines have since become a staple of the science fiction and fantasy genres, making <i>The Time Machine</i> one of the most deeply influential science fiction novels of the era.</p>

		<summary type="text">A shipwrecked man is rescued by a boat and left on a strange island owned by a physiologist who experiments in vivisection.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Island of Doctor Moreau</i> is the narration of Edward Prendick, a shipwrecked man who finds himself on a mysterious island full of humanoid animal creatures. He comes to find that these creatures are the work of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Moreau, a man who experiments in vivisection, and his assistant Montgomery.</p>
			<p>The story of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Moreau’s island began as an article in the January, 1895 issue of <i>Saturday Review</i>. It was later adapted into a novel. Its themes reflect concerns growing in the society of the day, like the cruelty of vivisection, degenerationism, and the theory of evolution.</p>

		<summary type="text">A scientist named Griffin creates a serum to render himself invisible and subsequently descends into madness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Griffin, a scientist, has devoted his life to the study of optics. As his work progresses, he invents a method of making a person invisible. After testing the experiment on himself, he comes to realize that while the experiment was a complete success, he has no way of reversing his invisibility.</p>
			<p>Written in a time of rapid scientific progress and industrial development, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells">Wells</a> uses Griffin’s struggle with his condition and descent into obsession and madness to reflect on the dangers of unbridled scientific progress untempered by compassion or humanity.</p>
			<p><i>The Invisible Man</i> was initially serialized in <i>Pearson’s Weekly</i> in 1897, after which it was published as a whole novel that same year.</p>

		<summary type="text">A young man returns to his home planet with news about Merlin, the military super-computer rumoured to be hidden somewhere on his world.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Cosmic Computer</i> is a 1963 science fiction novel by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-beam-piper"><abbr>H.</abbr> Beam Piper</a> based on his short story “Graveyard of Dreams,” which was published in the February 1958 issue of <i>Galaxy Magazine</i>.</p>
			<p>The action largely takes place on the planet Poictesme, which is full of abandoned military installations and equipment—hence the novel’s original name, <i>Junkyard Planet</i>. Young Conn Maxwell returns from Earth with long-awaited news about Merlin, a military computer with god-like abilities long rumored to be hidden somewhere on Poictesme. Though convinced that the story is just a myth, Conn and his father use the purported search for Merlin to drive the revitalization of the planet’s economy. In the process, they discover far more than they expected.</p>
			<p>As was typical for science fiction novels of the pulp era, there is little character development and women play a minor role, with romance given only a token treatment. The emphasis is on the conflicts over the spoils of the planet and the fiercely competitive search for the titular “cosmic computer.”</p>

		<summary type="text">On a planet being exploited for its resources, the discovery of a possibly-sentient native species creates consternation and conflict.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Little Fuzzy</i> is a science fiction novel set on the planet Zarathustra, a world rich in natural resources being exploited by a huge chartered company from Earth. Jack Holloway is a free-lance sunstone miner working on the outskirts of civilization when he encounters a small, fuzzy animal which turns out to be remarkably intelligent. He soon begins to suspect that “Little Fuzzy” and his family are more than just clever animals, but in fact a new sapient alien species. Such a proposition is directly opposed to the interests of the chartered Zarathustra Company, and conflict ensues.</p>
			<p>Published in 1962, <i>Little Fuzzy</i> rapidly gained popularity due to the charming nature of the little aliens and the well-handled tensions of the plot. It is today considered to be a classic of the genre, though perhaps considered to fall into the category of juvenile fiction. It was followed by a sequel, <i>Fuzzy Sapiens</i> in 1964.</p>

		<summary type="text">A doctor, jealous of his brother’s sudden wealth, starts questioning its provenance.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>The sons of the Roland family, Pierre and Jean, return home in the lull between the completion of their studies and the start of their professional careers, bringing the Roland family back together again, in a way. This peace, though, is broken when the younger brother Jean is left a life-changing inheritance by Maréchel, an old family friend—and Pierre is left with nothing. Despite the happiness in the rest of the family, unanswered questions start gnawing at Pierre.</p>
			<p><i>Pierre and Jean</i> was <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-de-maupassant">Guy de Maupassant’s</a> shortest novel, and is often acclaimed as his greatest. The setting for the novel is the scenery of de Maupassant’s childhood, and it is, accordingly, richly described. It was serialized in <i lang="fr">Nouvelle Revue</i> in 1887 before being published as a complete novel in 1888; this edition is based on the 1902 translation by Clara Bell.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of short stories by Gustave Flaubert.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> was an influential novelist who had both the characteristics of a romanticist and a realist. The short stories in this collection put that dichotomy on display.</p>
			<p>Flaubert wrote the first story, “The Dance of Death” when he was only 17 years old. It is written in a play format—though sometimes referred to as a prose poem—and features a conversation between Death, Satan and Nero. “The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitaller” is a story about Julian the Hospitaller, a man who shares some similarities with Oedipus; “A Simple Soul” tells the story of a servant girl named Felicité; and lastly “Herodias” retells the beheading of <abbr>St.</abbr> John the Baptist.</p>

			<p><i>The Shaving of Shagpat</i> isn’t just <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-meredith">George Meredith’s</a> first published novel, it’s also his only foray into fantasy literature. <i>Shagpat</i> sold poorly in its day despite good reviews, and after its disappointing sales Meredith pursed a career as a writer of romantic fiction instead. Despite its poor financial reception, <i>Shagpat</i> enjoys a good modern reputation and remains a classic of fantasy literature, with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-eliot">George Eliot</a> going so far as to call it a “work of genius.”</p>
			<p>The book is set in the medieval fantasy-Persia of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> and other oriental romances. Shibli Bagarag, a poor but talented barber, encounters a mystical crone named Noorna. Together they embark on a quest to save the city of Shagpat from a tyrant who holds the city under his command by virtue of the powers of his magical hair. On the way they battle genies and afreets, save princesses, hunt for treasures, and so on.</p>
			<p>Meredith’s language is purposefully florid, evoking the richness of the setting, and his frequent usage of quotations and aphorisms from “the poet” give the fantasy a decidedly literate air.</p>

		<summary type="text">The story of idealistic Barbara Undershaft, a Major in the Salvation Army, who does not want to be connected to her father’s “tainted” money.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Major Barbara</i> is a three-act play that premiered at the Court Theatre in 1905, and was subsequently published in 1907. It portrays idealist Barbara Undershaft, a Major in the Salvation Army, and her encounter with her long-estranged father who has made his fortune as a “dealer of death” in the munitions industry. Barbara doesn’t wish to be associated with her father’s ill-gotten wealth, but can’t prevent him from donating to the Salvation Army and eventually converting her family to his capitalist views on how best to help the poor.</p>
			<p>In the preface, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-bernard-shaw">Shaw</a> addresses his critics and explicates his actual attitudes towards the Salvation Army, versus the attitudes and fates portrayed by his characters and responded to by the critics. He continues on to discuss the issues of wealth and poverty, religion and science, and how they all fit into his views of society.</p>
			<p><i>Major Barbara</i> is one of the most controversial of Shaw’s work and was greeted with decidedly mixed reviews, yet it endures as one of his most famous plays.</p>

		<summary type="text">A humorous examination of human hypocrisy and war’s stupidity in the midst of the Serbo-Bulgarian war.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the middle of the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian war, an enemy soldier escapes a cavalry charge by climbing up a drainpipe into Raina Petkoff’s room. Raina is the daughter of one Major and engaged to another, but she chooses to save the soldier’s life by concealing him.</p>
			<p><i>Arms and the Man</i>, named after the opening lines of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virgil">Virgil’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virgil/the-aeneid/john-dryden">The Aeneid</a></i>, is a play that humorously deals with the hypocrisy of humanity and the stupidity of war. It was among <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-bernard-shaw">George Bernard Shaw’s</a> first commercial successes, and was included in a collection of plays he referred to as <i>Plays Pleasant</i>, along with <i>Candida</i>, <i>You Never Can Tell</i>, and <i>The Man of Destiny</i>. Having coined the term “chocolate soldier,” the play has been staged multiple times in London’s West End and on Broadway, and has been adapted into operetta and film.</p>

		<summary type="text">A mysterious presence terrorizes the Paris Opera.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>“When I die and am in Heaven,” Christine Daaé’s father said, “I will send the Angel of Music to you.” It is with these words still in her ears years later that Christine accepts the disembodied voice that speaks to her to claim that divine title, and to give her singing lessons within her dressing room at the Paris Opera, as the fulfillment of her beloved father’s promise. And when those lessons lead her to a performance that astonishes the whole city, who could doubt but that the Angel had indeed come?</p>
			<p>Yet there is another, more sinister presence stalking about the Opéra Garnier: the Opera Ghost. A creature who not only makes inconvenient demands—such as the exclusive use of Box Five at every performance, as well as a sizable retainer paid monthly—but who also hangs a man for wandering into the wrong part of the Opera’s cavernous cellars, and sends a chandelier plunging down onto the heads of a packed house when his demands are not met.</p>
			<p>But is the Opéra truly host to so many supernatural phenomena, or could it be that the Angel and the Opera Ghost are in fact one and the same? And could it be also that he is far less angel than demon? And if so, will Christine realize her peril before it is too late?</p>

			<p>Father Brown, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton"><abbr>G. K.</abbr> Chesterton’s</a> crime-solving Catholic priest, is back in this second collection of Father Brown short stories.</p>
			<p>In this collection, Brown is joined by his sidekick, the former arch-criminal Flambeau. Brown is directly involved in the investigations less frequently than in <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton/the-innocence-of-father-brown">The Innocence of Father Brown</a></i>, and several of the stories don’t even feature murder. Despite this, the shorts each feature Brown solving a mystery using his characteristic insight into human nature and morality.</p>
			<p>The stories in this collection were initially published in various serials, including <i>McClure’s Magazine</i> and <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>. Chesterton arranged them in this collection almost in order of publication.</p>

		<summary type="text">A satire set in far-future London where the king, who was chosen at random, only cares about a good joke.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</i>, like so many <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton">Chesterton</a> novels, deftly straddles the fence between humor and philosophy. The place is London, in the far-future year of 1984. Inexplicably, not too much has changed since the turn of the century—except that the king is chosen at random. Things quickly take a turn for the worse when the people randomly select an imbecile who only cares about a good joke.</p>
			<p>With the new prankster king in place, the novel continues on with surprisingly action-packed breeziness, exploring themes of identity, patriotism, politics, and government.</p>

		<summary type="text">Amateur detective and Catholic priest Father Brown solves mysteries in this first collection of Father Brown short stories.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Father Brown is a Catholic priest, but a slightly unusual one in that he’s <em>also</em> an amateur detective. Unlike his more famous literary cousin <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock</a>, Father Brown takes a less analytical and more intuition-oriented approach to solving the many murders that he happens to come across.</p>
			<p>This collection of short murder mysteries is Brown’s first appearance on the literary stage. In it we see him practicing his unique brand of sleuthing alongside his sometimes-partner, the reformed master criminal Flambeau.</p>

		<summary type="text">G. K. Chesterton’s unique view on Christianity and how all his “solitary and sincere speculations” were ultimately answered by its theology.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><i>Orthodoxy</i> is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton">G. K. Chesterton’s</a> response to his critics’ assertion that his earlier collection of essays, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton/heretics">Heretics</a></i>, had “merely criticised current philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy.” In his intellectual journey from pagan to agnostic to positivist philosopher, he had attempted to build a philosophy “some ten minutes in advance of the truth.” But when he compared his modern philosophy with Christian theology, he realized that he was “the man who with the utmost daring discovered what had been discovered before.” Thus, <i>Orthodoxy</i> is a work of Christian apologetics, where Chesterton tries to show that Christianity is a universal answer to the everyday needs of humanity, and not just an arbitrary philosophy handed down from on high.</p>

		<summary type="text">A banal and paranoid school teacher falls slowly into madness.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>Ardalyon Borisitch Peredonov believes himself better than his job as a teacher, and hopes that the Princess will be able to promote him to the position of Inspector. Unfortunately for him his connection to the Princess is through his fiancée Varvara, and she has her own plans. With little sign of the desired position his life of petty cruelty escalates, even as his grip on reality begins to break apart and his paranoia manifests itself in hallucinations of a shadowy creature.</p>
			<p>Finished in 1907, <i>The Little Demon</i> (alternatively translated as <i>The Petty Demon</i>) is <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub">Fyodor Sologub’s</a> most famous novel, and received both popular and critical attention on its publication despite its less-than-favorable depictions of provincial Russian life. Its portrayal of Peredonov as a paranoid character simultaneously both banal and bereft of goodness is an essay on the Russian concept of <i lang="ru">poshlost</i>; a theme that makes an appearance in many other Russian novels, not least Chichikov in Gogol’s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/nikolai-gogol/dead-souls/d-j-hogarth"><i>Dead Souls</i></a>. This translation (primarily by John Cournos) was published in 1916, and includes a preface by Sologub for the English-speaking reader.</p>

		<summary type="text">A collection of Fyodor Sologub’s translated short stories, ordered by date of the publication of their translation.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub">Fyodor Sologub</a> was a Russian poet, novelist and playwright, working in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His work generally has a downcast outlook with recurring mystical elements, and often uses anthropomorphic objects or fantastical situations to comment on human behaviour. As well as novels (including the critically acclaimed <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub/the-little-demon/john-cournos_richard-aldington">The Little Demon</a></i>), Sologub wrote over five hundred short stories, ranging in length from half-page fables to nearly novella-length tales.</p>
			<p>While most of his short stories were not contemporaneously translated, both John Cournos and Stephen Graham produced English compilations and contributed individual stories to publications such as <i>The Russian Review</i> and <i>The Egoist</i>. This collection comprises the best individual English translations in the public domain of Sologub’s short stories, presented in chronological order of the publication of their translation.</p>

		<summary type="text">A Russian tutor deals with the outcomes of the allure of roulette.</summary>
		<content type="text/html">
			<p>In the fictional town of Roulettenberg, Germany, a Russian tutor to the children of a seemingly wealthy general is enticed to play roulette at the local casino. First playing for others (including his beloved Polina Alexandrovna), he soon gets a taste for the experience himself, which can lead in only one direction.</p>
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a> wrote this story based at least partially on personal experience. After his second marriage (and the successful publication of <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky/crime-and-punishment/constance-garnett"><i>Crime and Punishment</i></a>) he and his wife took a honeymoon in Baden-Baden, where Dostoevsky lost large quantities of money at the roulette table. To get his financial situation back to normal he then set up a wager with his publisher: they’d have the right to publish his work for free for nine years if he couldn’t deliver this novel by November 1866. He succeeded in this, and was able to move on to writing <i>The Idiot</i>.</p>
			<p><i>The Gambler</i> has been translated to screen and radio, and was even turned into an opera by Prokofiev. This edition is the 1915 translation by <abbr>C. J.</abbr> Hogarth.</p>
